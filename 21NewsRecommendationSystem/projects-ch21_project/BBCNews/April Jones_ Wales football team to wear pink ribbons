The Wales football team will wear pink ribbons in support of missing five-year-old April Jones ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Scotland.They will be pinned to the players' tracksuits during the anthems at Cardiff City Stadium on Friday.April, from Machynlleth, Powys, has been missing since 1 October and pink is said to be her favourite colour.Meanwhile, a fund set up in her name has raised nearly £20,000, with donations from as far afield as the US.Mark Bridger of Machynlleth is charged with murder, abduction and attempting to pervert the course of justice.The 46-year-old appeared at Caernarfon Crown Court on Wednesday via video link and was remanded in custody.On the same day, April's parents visited the specialist police search base at Y Plas community hall in Machynlleth to thank those searching for their daughter.Wales manager Chris Coleman will also wear a ribbon throughout Friday night's game in Cardiff, while the Scottish players are expected to do the same.Machynlleth has been draped in pink since April's mother launched a pink ribbon appeal to support the search for her daughter.To mark the week since her disappearance her parents released a sky lantern on Monday evening while others in the town released pink balloons.In Blackpool, the seaside tower was also lit up in pink.Meanwhile, a fund set up by Machynlleth Town Council a few days after April went missing has raised nearly £20,000.It is unclear what the money will be used for, but it will be for April's family to decide how it is spent, says the council.Town council secretary Izzy Lumley said: "We've received over £19,000 and donations are coming in from all over the place."People have also turned up here from all over Wales to donate money."Yesterday, we had a party of taxi drivers from Dublin and they donated £300. We seem to think they donated their tips."Search and rescue teams, who have already done an enormous amount, have also donated money."She said £600 had come from a cake stall in nearby Newtown, while a similar amount had been raised by charity event in Cardigan."We've had money from all over the UK and a church in the United States has also donated," Ms Lumley said.She added that the largest couple of one-off donations had amounted to about £1,000 each and were given anonymously.April's disappearance sparked a huge police and community response which has included hundreds of trained and voluntary search teams.The search is on-going.However, the Search and Rescue Dog Association in Wales said its volunteers had called a halt to their search. The organisation thanked people in Machynlleth for their help.
