Apple seeks sales ban on more Samsung handsets
Apple has added the best-selling Samsung Galaxy S3 handset to a list of products it says infringe its patents.The Galaxy Note tablet is also included in a new list of 21 gadgets submitted to a court in California.It is not the same court that last month awarded Apple $1.05bn (Â£644m) after finding Samsung guilty of "wilful" infringement.If the new court initially finds infringement, it has the power to halt Galaxy sales in the US before trial."Rather than innovate and develop its own technology and a unique Samsung style for its smartphone and tablet computer products, Samsung has chosen to copy Apple's technology, user interface, and innovative style," Apple said in a legal document, as reported by the AP news agency.Samsung in turn accused the US tech giant of limiting consumer choice."Apple continues to resort to litigation over market competition in an effort to limit consumer choice," Samsung said in a statement."We will continue to take the necessary legal measures to ensure the availability of our innovative products in the United States."More than 10 million Galaxy S3 handsets have been sold worldwide since its launch in May 2012.Stuart Miles, editor of the Pocket Lint website, told the BBC Apple "would be stupid not to" seek to have other infringing products banned from sale, but he did not believe consumers would suffer."Consumers will benefit as Samsung will have to innovate even further - it means we'll have better choice," he said."If you like the iPhone OS you'll go for iPhone, and if you don't, Samsung will have other cool features."
