Banned in Cannes: Stars who gave high heels the boot
After allegations that theCannes Film Festival has banned women without high heels, we look at outfits at other awards ceremonies that would not have made the cut.From the Grammys to the Oscars, there is a fine tradition of actresses choosing to keep it flat on the red carpet.Based in snowy Utah, the Sundance Film Festival traditionally has a more casual look than other award ceremonies.......But at Cannes, heels are de rigueur for the Twilight starAlthough a heel aficionado at Cannes, Helen Mirren borrowed a style reference from her Oscar-winning role in The Queen at the Tony Theatre AwardsBig Bang Theory star Melissa Rauch also got into the alpine spirit at the Sundance Film FestivalA pregnant M.I.A brought white trainers to the Grammys, parading them on the red carpet before performing on stageLiza Minnelli kept it simple at the most glamorous event of all - The OscarsAnd of course, with a no-heels policy, Ellen wouldn't have been able to present the Oscars in 2014And Emma Thompson famously couldn't bear wearing her heels for a moment longer at the Golden Globes: "I just want you to know, this red? It's my blood."
