Bath's Churchill Bridge closed for repairs
Round the clock repairs have begun at a bridge in Bath city centre and will continue for the next three weeks.Churchill Bridge is one of the main routes into Bath for commuters travelling in from the south.Bath and North East Somerset Council has said the bridge deck needs resurfacing and re-waterproofing and the movement joints need repairing.Cabinet member Roger Symonds said: "We did consider just closing one lane but that would have taken 10 weeks."But he said that would have caused "awful disruption" and "wouldn't have been particularly safe so we've decided to close the bridge for a shorter period of time".Although contractors will work 24 hours a day where possible, noise restrictions will be put in place.Diversions have also been put in place.Repairs are expected to be completed by 4 May.
