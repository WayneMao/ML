Air routes linking Oban with Scottish destinations mooted
A transport organisation has sought public views on whether new air routes should be provided in Scotland.Hitrans has suggested linking Oban with Glasgow, Campbeltown and Barra.It has also asked whether there should be greater availability of flights on the existing route between Glasgow and Barra's beach airport.Hitrans is also involved in discussions about resuming commercial flights to Skye. Its new online survey will run until 10 June.Director Ranald Robertson said: "This study will provide an invaluable evidence base that will consider in detail the complex operational, regulatory and budgetary constraints which impact on the provision of air services in the Highlands and Islands."This work will also investigate the feasibility of any new operations and forecast the impact these are likely to have in terms of fleet, crewing and operating costs."A feasibility study published in March suggested resuming commercial flights to and from Skye could require capital spending of between £9.7m and £15.3m.Loganair flew out of the island's Highland Council-owned Ashaig Airfield, near Broadford, until 1988.Hitrans, Highland Council and Highlands and Islands Enterprise have been looking at the possibility of resuming commercial flights to and from Skye.
