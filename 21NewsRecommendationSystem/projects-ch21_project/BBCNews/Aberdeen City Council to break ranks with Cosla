Aberdeen City Council to break ranks with Cosla
Councillors in Aberdeen have voted to break ranks with the local government umbrella body Cosla.The decision to leave the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was announced late on Thursday night.It came amid growing anger over the financial settlement the city receives from the Scottish government.Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said it should not weaken the authority's bargaining position.The authority has given 12 months' notice that it intends to terminate its Â£110,000-a-year membership.Dumfries and Galloway Council has already tabled plans to quit Cosla.A Cosla spokesman said:  "Cosla is the only local government association in the United Kingdom with a 100% membership."This will continue to be the case for the rest of this financial year and all of next financial year, and during this time the organisation will be doing its absolute utmost to ensure that we resolve the issues that have been raised with us, as well as representing our full 32-council membership."Aberdeen Council had earlier passed its budget and capital spending plans, including no cuts to services, a council tax freeze, and spending on projects including the so-called third River Don crossing.Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire councillors will be asked to approve their budget and spending plans next Thursday.
