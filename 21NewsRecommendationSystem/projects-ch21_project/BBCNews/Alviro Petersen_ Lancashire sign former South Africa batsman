Alviro Petersen: Lancashire sign former South Africa batsman
Lancashire have signed former South Africa opening batsman Alviro Petersen on a two-year contract.The 34-year-old quit international cricket earlier this month following aTest series win against West Indies.The formerGlamorgan,EssexandSomersetplayer scored 2,093 runs at an average of 34.88, including five hundreds, in his 36 Test appearances.He will join as a non-overseas player under the Kolpak ruling, and has the option of a third year with the county."We are delighted to bring a player of Alviro's calibre to Old Trafford," said Lancashire boss Ashley Giles."His experience at the top of the order, both internationally and domestically, is second to none and he will bring outstanding quality to our batting unit."He is a player who is well respected within the game and his experience will be of immense benefit to our younger batsmen."Petersen spent the last two seasons as an overseas player at Somerset, playing 17 first-class matches and scoring 1,167 runs.Kolpak contracts are signed by foreign players, using a loophole in European Union law to avoid counting against the quota of one overseas player per club - and Petersen's move means Lancashire are yet to fill their overseas berth for 2015.
