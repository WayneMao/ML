Media playback is not supported on this devicePegasus coach Arlene Boyles says the opportunity for her club to compete in a new All-Ireland League was "too big an opportunity to miss"."We want to pit ourselves against the best opposition, week in, week out, and help inspire and create the next generation of interpro and international players."It is very different but it should be grasped with both hands. It provides an opportunity for clubs and players to develop on an All-Ireland stage," said Boyles.
