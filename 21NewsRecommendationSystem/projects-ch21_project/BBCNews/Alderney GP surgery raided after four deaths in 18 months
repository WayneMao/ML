Alderney GP surgery raided after four deaths in 18 months
Four patient deaths which prompted a police raid on an Alderney GP's surgery occurred within an 18-month period, officials have said.Documents and other items have been removed from the Eagle Medical Practice since the raid on Thursday morning.Guernsey Police chief officer Patrick Rice said he did not want anyone to indulge in "unhelpful speculation" while the investigation was under way.No arrests have been made but Dr Rory Lyons has been suspended.Police entered the surgery, run by Dr Lyons and which has about 500 patients out of an island population of about 1,900, at about 10:30 BST on Thursday.As well as the surgery in Ollivier Street, St Anne's, a private residence on the island has also been searched.Police chief Rice said on Thursday that officers began looking at the surgery after "concerns were raised with the Health and Social Services Department following the death of a patient who had been under the care of the Eagle Medical Practice".Guernsey's Health and Social Services Department (HSSD), which is responsible for the health and well-being of the people of Alderney, confirmed that concerns about one death this year triggered its initial investigation.Chief HSSD officer Dr Carol Tozer said: "We can confirm that concerns were raised with HSSD shortly after the death of a patient earlier this year."The internal HSSD investigation began immediately and identified three further deaths of concern, all occurring within the last 18 months."The General Medical Council had also been informed, the department added.HSSD staff have been sent to Alderney to provide information and advice to concerned patients.Chief Officer Rice said officers would investigate as quickly and efficiently as possible to reassure residents.
