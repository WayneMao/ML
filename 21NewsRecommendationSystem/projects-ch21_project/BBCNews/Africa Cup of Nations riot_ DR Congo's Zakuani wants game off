Media playback is not supported on this deviceDefender Gabriel Zakuani wants DR Congo to pull out of their Africa Cup of Nations third-place play-off against Equatorial Guinea amid security fears.His side face the hosts on Saturday at the same venue whererioting marred the home side's semi-final against Ghana."If they're throwing this [rocks and glass] at players, Eq Guinea, you can have 3rd place, I love football but prefer to live,"Zakuani, 28, tweeted.Equatorial Guinea's football federation has been finedÂ£65,000 for the trouble.It has also been told by the Confederation of African Football (Caf) to meet the cost of treatment of the 36 injured supporters.Caf ordered Equatorial Guinea to play one match behind closed doors, but suspended the sanction "in the spirit of fair play".This means Saturday's game (16:00 GMT) is set to be played in front of spectators despite the Ghana Football Association president saying fans could have died in the crowd trouble on Thursday."We're lucky we haven't lost any lives, though people have sustained injuries arising from objects thrown at them," Kwesi Nyantakyi told BBC World Service.A stadium worker is seriously injured in hospital after he suffered several broken limbs when attacked by rioting fans as he cleared rubbish bins.It is understood that Zakuani, whoplays for English League One side Peterborough United,is not the only DR Congo player who wants Saturday's game at Malabo Stadium called off on security grounds.However, DR Congo head coach Florent Ibenge said he is happy for the game to go ahead."We are serene and we are preparing to play this game," he said. "We want to win this third place and give joy but we are really not scared of this."On Thursday, play was halted for 30 minutes as home fans rioted at the match whereGhana beat hosts Equatorial Guinea 3-0.Police used tear gas as bottles and stones were thrown by home supporters at the 15,250-capacity venue.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe Ghana FA said it was "like a war zone", while Nyantakyi described the conduct of some Equatorial Guinea supporters as "the highest state of barbarism".He told BBC World Service: "African football has grown beyond this level and in the 21st century we expect to see more decency in the behaviour of fans."A high-profile game of this nature should have attracted police, intelligence officers and military. "Emilio Nsue, captain of Equatorial Guinea, said: "Regarding the public and the way they acted, I've never experienced that. I'd like to say sorry. It was something we've never experienced before."Equatorial Guinea agreed to host the tournament afterMorocco pulled out in Novemberbecause of its fears over the Ebola outbreak elsewhere on the continent.Ghana will play Ivory Coast, who beat DR Congo 3-1, in Sunday's final (19:00 GMT) in Bata, on the west coast of Equatorial Guinea.
