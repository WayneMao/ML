Anthony Jeffrey: Boreham Wood sign Concord winger on loan
National League side Boreham Wood have signed winger Anthony Jeffrey on loan from Concord Rangers.The 20-year-old ex-Arsenal youngster has played for the Wood twice before, once on loan from the Gunners and again after leaving Wycombe in 2014."I've had a good chat with him about the importance of showing me a good attitude, about applying himself and what I expect," said boss Ian Allinson.Meanwhile, midfielder Graeme Montgomery has joined St Albans on a 93-day loan.The 27-year-old cannot commit to the new daytime training schedule because of work commitments, but issues that club captain Sam Cox and striker Charlie MacDonald were having with the change have been resolved.
