Americans join 'pasty tax' protest in Cornwall
Opponents of the government's plans to change the way hot food is taxed, the so-called "pasty tax", have found support from across the Atlantic.People living in Calumet, Michigan, are so proud of their Cornish connections, they have gathered a petition of 500 signatures to show their support.And they visited twin town Camborne in Cornwall to present it to the mayor.The government says it is unfair to tax takeaway foods like fish and chips differently to things like pasties.Proposals in the March Budget mean a tax of 20% would be charged on pasties, as well as pies.The plans have been met with resistance from high street bakers Greggs as well as MPs from all parties.Jeanette Medlyn, from Calumet, said: "When the pasty tax came out we thought that would be horrible to have here so we wanted to stand in solidarity with the people in Cornwall and particularly our twin town of Camborne."In the 19th Century thousands of Cornish miners headed to Michigan to work in the copper mines.Ms Medlyn said: "Pasties are the mainstay of our diet. Every time we have relatives or friends coming from a distance the first thing we do is call the pasty shop and order a dozen pasties for dinner."And they love it."Mayor of Camborne Jean Charman said: "I am absolutely delighted to have their support."They are still our Cornish cousins. I have been to Calumet and I know how much they appreciate the heritage."A cross-party attempt to reverse the tax was defeated by the government which is consulting on the proposed changes. The deadline for responses is 18 May.
