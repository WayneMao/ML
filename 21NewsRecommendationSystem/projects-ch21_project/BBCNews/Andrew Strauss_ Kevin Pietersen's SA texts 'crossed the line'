Andrew Strauss: Kevin Pietersen's SA texts 'crossed the line'
Kevin Pietersen "crossed the line" when hesent "provocative" messagesto the South Africa team in 2012, according to former England captain Andrew Strauss.Pietersen was dropped from the England teamfor the final Test of that series,and underwent a "reintegration" period before his eventual return.In his autobiography, Strauss admits to being "dumbfounded" at the incident."He seemed to be at best destabilising and at worst undermining our carefully cultivated team environment," he said.In his book, serialised inthe Daily Mail,Strauss has written in depth about the controversy, which overshadowed the final days of his England captaincy.Since the incident, Pietersen admitted sending messages to his "close friends" in the Proteas dressing room but denied initial reports that he passed on information on how to get Strauss out.31 May 2012:Announces retirementfrom international limited-overs cricket11 Aug:Commits to all forms of international cricketin a YouTube interview12 Aug:Dropped for third Test against South Africa forsending "provocative texts"about team-mates to opposition players21 Aug:Left out ofEngland squad for World Twenty207 Sept:Not awardedECB central contract18 Sept:Omitted from England Test squadfor winter tour of India3 Oct:Pietersen signs new contract and agrees toundergo "reintegration" periodStrauss, who also revealed Pietersen visited his houseto explain himself and apologise,says he is satisfied the messages did not contain such information but the issue marred his final days as a professional cricketer - admitting he was "wallowing in a rising tide of sadness" as the story developed."I wasn't all that bothered about him sending texts to the South African players he knew quite well," said the 36-year-old. "I did, however, have issues with him criticising me to the opposition."That felt like talking out of school, not to mention giving the opposition a way to drive a wedge between Pietersen and myself and the team."And if he really had given information about how to get me out, well that amounted to treachery and I would never forgive him."I am confident, in retrospect, that he did not give the South Africans information on how to get me out."The nagging frustration I still have is that all of that time, effort and commitment from our players over a three-year period to make our environment special and different was undermined in one episode."Former Middlesex batsman Strauss also revealed that hisdecision to quit the sporthad not been forced by the furore surrounding Pietersen, and instead cited poor form with the bat as the main "driver".He spent this summer's Ashes series working as a television pundit and is believed to bemulling over the opportunityto replace Hugh Morris as England's managing director of cricket.Should he be eventually given the job, he would effectively be Pietersen's backroom chief.Pietersen missed last year's World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka but returned for the winter Test series against India and helped the team to an historic victory on the sub-continent.The 33-year-old could win his 100th cap for England in this winter's Ashes series in Australia.
