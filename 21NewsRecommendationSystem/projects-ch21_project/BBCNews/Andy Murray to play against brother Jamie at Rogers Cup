Andy Murray to play against brother Jamie at Rogers Cup
British number one Andy Murray will play brother Jamie for the first time in a Tour-level match when they meet in men's doubles at the Rogers Cup.Andy Murray and Leander Paes beat Jeremy Chardy and Kevin Anderson 6-3 6-1 to set up a second-round tie with Jamie and John Peers in Montreal."We've not played each other for a long time so it'll be nice in some ways, but also it's not easy," said Andy Murray.In-form seventh seeds Murray and Peers recently won the German Open.The pair, who are on course to qualify for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in London, also reached the Wimbledon final this year.In the men's singles, second seed Murray has received a first-round bye so will meet Tommy Robredo in the second round.
