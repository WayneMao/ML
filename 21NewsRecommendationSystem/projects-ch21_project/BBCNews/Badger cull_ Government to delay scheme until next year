Badger cull: Government to delay scheme until next year
The government has announced it will delay a planned cull of badgers in England until next summer, after widespread protests against the scheme.Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said this was necessary to "get it right" and the "optimal time" for this year had passed.Under coalition plans, several thousand badgers could be shot, in an effort to reduce levels of bovine tuberculosis.The anti-cull campaigner and Queen guitarist Brian May welcomed the delay.Ministers have given approval for a cull in two areas, Gloucestershire and west Somerset, as part of efforts to control bovine TB.Under the plans, badgers will be shot in the open without first being trapped in cages, which is current practice.Opponents, including the RSPCA, say that is inhumane, with an e-petition to the government attracting more than 160,000 signatures.In a statement to MPs, Mr Paterson said the cull "should have begun" earlier this summer but had been delayed until after the Olympics and Paralympics, with recent bad weather also hampering preparations.But he said that the alternative - a vaccine - was only 50% to 60% effective, adding: "I'm entirely convinced that the badger cull is the right thing to do."The National Farmers' Union is leading the preparations for the scheme, but Mr Paterson said it had written to him asking for a delay, as this was not the best time of year to go ahead.He said badger numbers in Gloucestershire and Somerset were higher than had been previously thought, adding: "It's crucial that we get this right."The government's plan is based on the results of a nine-year trial which showed the spread of the disease could be slowed slightly if more than 70% of badgers in an area could be eradicated. But if it was less than 70%, the spread of TB could increase, it found.Mr Paterson said: "It would be wrong to go ahead if those on the ground cannot be confident of removing at least 70% of the population."He added: "By starting the pilots next summer, we can build on the work that's already been done and ensure that the cull will conform to the scientific criteria and the evidence base."For Labour Mary Creagh, shadow environment secretary, called the government's handling of the badger cull "incompetent and shambolic"."Once again, ministers present the House with a disaster entirely of their own making. Once again, it's farmers and taxpayers who are left counting the cost," she said."Bovine TB is a terrible disease for farmers, their families and their communities. But this cull was never going to be a silver bullet."RSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said: "We welcome this postponement, but this must not be a temporary reprieve, but must mark an end to all cull plans."Science, the public and MPs from all parties had said very clearly that a cull is no answer to bovine TB."Brian May, who has campaigned against the cull, called the government announcement "at least a temporary reprieve".He added: "But let's be very clear: this is a scientifically flawed, ethically reprehensible, economically unjustifiable and reckless policy that needs to be abandoned, once and for all."But Peter Jones, president of the British Veterinary Association,  said: "The science has not changed. Scientists agree that culling badgers does reduce the levels of infection in cattle herds, and we know that no country has dealt with bovine TB without tackling the disease in wildlife."The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says the cull is necessary to protect cattle from bovine TB.Last year, 26,000 cattle in England had to be slaughtered after contracting the disease.The Welsh government has opted for a system of vaccination while Scotland is officially TB-free.
