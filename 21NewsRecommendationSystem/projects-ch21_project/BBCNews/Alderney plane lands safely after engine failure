Alderney plane lands safely after engine failure
A plane managed to land safely at Alderney Airport after its pilot was forced to shut down one of its three engines mid-flight.The Aurigny Air Services Trislander was 23 miles north of Alderney heading to Southampton when the pilot reported an issue with a loose engine cowling.A full emergency was declared at about 08:35 BST and the island's emergency services were put on alert.The plane, with seven passengers on board, landed safely just before 08:50.Five of those passengers continued their journey on a replacement aircraft sent from Guernsey.Aurigny said the other two chose to remain on Alderney having missed their business meetings.Malcolm Hart, the company's managing director, said: "We apologise for the disruption this has caused our passengers and will of course make a full investigation into the incident.""At no point were any of the passengers in any danger and our scheduling during the course of the day should be unaffected," he added.
