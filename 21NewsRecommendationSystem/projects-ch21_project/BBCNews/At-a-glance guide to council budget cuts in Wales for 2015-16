This presents almost incomprehensible challenges."It also means that Monmouthshire will be set to receive the lowest funding per resident of any Welsh council. I cannot understand why Monmouthshire's residents should be so disadvantaged. We will get £1,018 per person to deliver all of our services when neighbouring authorities will receive between £380 to £560 more for each of their residents.  It's just not fair.Neath Port Talbot-2.4% cut - dropping from £210.1 to £205.1m in 2015-16Neath Port Talbot chief executive Steve Phillips said the settlement means the authority has to save about £20m instead of £23m it had anticipated.He said while the situation is still not easy, "it could have been worse".Newport-2.6% cut - dropping from £214.9m to £209.4m in 2015-16Newport council says its 2.6% budget cut means it will need to save an extra £5m on top of the £4.9m it was planning to save next year in addition to the £50m of cuts in the "past few years".Pembrokeshire-4.2% cut - dropping from £167.2m to £160.3m in 2015-16Pembrokeshire County Council leader Jamie Adams described the 4.2% cut as "grim", adding: "It is inevitable that frontline service delivery will be impacted."Powys-4.4% cut - dropping from £182.4m to £174.3m in 2015-16Rhondda Cynon Taf-3.7% cut - dropping from £367.8m to £354.4m in 2015-16Swansea-3.4% cut - dropping from £318.4m to £307.7m in 2015-16Torfaen-3.7% cut - dropping from £135.9m to £130.8m in 2015-16Vale of Glamorgan-3.4% cut - dropping from £157.8m to £152.5m in 2015-16Wrexham-2.9% cut - dropping from £175.3m to £170.3m in 2015-16Wrexham council says it needs to makebudget savings of £11m for 2015/16.Council leader Mark Pritchard said: "The Welsh government have prioritised resources on health at the expense of local government services. This has resulted in yet another poor settlement and put even more pressure on local services."
