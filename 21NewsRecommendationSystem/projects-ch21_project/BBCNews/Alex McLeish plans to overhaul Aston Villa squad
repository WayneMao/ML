Media playback is not supported on this deviceDefiant Aston Villa boss Alex McLeish says he expects to stay at the club and rebuild the team in the summer.McLeish was booed by Villa fans throughout Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Norwich, after a season in which the club escaped relegation by two points."That team needs a change and there will be change. We need to bring more quality into the squad," said McLeish."I'm expecting the board to back me. I understand the fans' frustrations about that display but I'm not a quitter."Villa were dominated at Carrow Road, as goals from Grant Holt and Simeon Jackson helped the Canaries to a resounding victory.Villa failed to win any of their last 10 matches of the season and the club's final points tally of 38 is their lowest since 1987."It was an absolutely shocking, woeful display. Maybe some of the boys were thinking about their holidays already," said the Villa boss.However, McLeish - who has a meeting with club owner Randy Lerner scheduled for next week - insists he remains the man to get the club back on track."I might not have had the riches to spend of other managers, but believe I can turn Aston Villa around by adding quality and players who are going to work their socks off," said McLeish, who moved to Villa from rivals Birmingham following their relegation last season."It is up to me to turn the opinion around. I have to get a team in that Villa jersey with a winning mentality."Media playback is not supported on this deviceThere were opposing emotions for Norwich manager Paul Lambert after a season in which the Canaries defied expectations to finish 12th in the Premier League table."We were fantastic and relentless, some of the football we played was very good," said Lambert.However, the City manager was vague when asked whether he would still be at Norwich next season."It is a hard one to answer because I have a contract here and everyone is doing great in their respective jobs," said the former Celtic and Borussia Dortmund player."I will get this season out of the road and then I will see what happens and think about what is going on and the achievements we have done and then we will see."
