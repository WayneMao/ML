An artist pays tribute to the female bikers of Morocco with portraits that flip our expectations.
Hassan Hajjaj was born in Morocco, but moved to London at an early age. The photographer – whodesigned a menswear collection with designer Amine Bendriouichlast year – combines the hip hop and reggae influences of his UK upbringing with a North African aesthetic.Hajjaj’s portraits of young women wearing traditional Islamic dress while posing on motorbikes appear in his first exhibition in New York, which opens tomorrow at theTaymour Grahne Gallery. As well as photographs and an installation, a video projection will show a woman riding a motorcycle through the Medina.The artist has two more shows in the US right now: theLos Angeles County Museum of Artis showing a work it recently acquired, the video My Rock Stars, Volume 1, 2012,that features nine musical performances. The musicians wear clothes designed by Hajjaj, mixing traditional fabrics with clothes and shoes from luxury brands.Meanwhile, Hajjaj’s work atGusford Galleryin LA is a photographic series portraying his friends as rock stars. Taken in a pop-up studio that travelled through Morocco, London and Paris, the shots bring together the spontaneity of street portraiture with the language of fashion photography.If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.
