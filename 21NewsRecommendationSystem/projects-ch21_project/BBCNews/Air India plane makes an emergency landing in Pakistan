Air India plane makes an emergency landing in Pakistan
An Air India flight from Abu Dhabi to Delhi, with 122 passengers on board, has made an emergency landing in Pakistan following a technical snag.The plane landed at the Nawabshah airport in Sindh province "after developing hydraulics failure", India's Aviation Minister Ajit Singh said.All the passengers were safe and a relief plane had been sent to bring them to Delhi, he added.Air India has also sent a team of engineers to repair the Airbus.The captain of the aircraft contacted Pakistani authorities early Monday morning and sought permission for an emergency landing after detecting the problem with the hydraulics system, Pakistani civil aviation authority spokesman Pervez George told Press Trust of India.India's national carrier has been suffering major problems in the last few years.It is severely in debt and earlier this year the government approved a debt-restructuring plan worth nearly $6bn (Â£3.8bn) to turn around the ailing airline.A 58-day strike by Air India pilots over training and pay ended just last week.
