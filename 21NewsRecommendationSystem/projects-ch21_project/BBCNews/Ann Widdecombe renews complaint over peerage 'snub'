Ann Widdecombe renews complaint over peerage 'snub'
Ex-MP Ann Widdecombe has renewed her complaint that she was "deliberately" snubbed by David Cameron for a peerage.Miss Widdecombe told the BBC as she was an "obvious candidate" for a seat in the House of Lords, it was clear the PM had decided to exclude her.Speaking to the Fern Britton Meets programme, the former Tory minister said she would "be a liar" if she said the decision "didn't stab a little".She first spoke out about the apparent snub in April.Miss Widdecombe told the BBC One programme: "It was ... let's be honest about it, a pretty pointed exclusion. I mean David Cameron was making vast quantities of peerages. He had to in order to redress the balance in the Lords."And I was an obvious candidate and I wasn't there and that means that he had taken a decision that I would not be there."I'd be a liar if I didn't say that an exclusion that pointed didn't stab just a little bit but I am a great one for saying 'It's no good looking back'."In April,the Telegraph reportedthat Miss Widdecombe said she thought Mr Cameron denied her a peerage because she was "too traditional".The former politician, who made a popular appearance on Strictly Come Dancing last year, also talked about the coalition.She said although Mr Cameron had been "brave" in some of his actions since arriving at Number 10, he had "been very misguided in the way that he's dealt with Nick Clegg in as much as he forgets who the senior members of the coalition are and the Liberals are only there because of us."She added: "They are not there in their own right. They actually lost seats, they didn't prevail in the last election, they need reminding of that from time to time," she said."But he should just call their bluff and say: 'What do you want, an early election?"'Speaking from her home in Devon, she added: "If ... he was expecting that I would sit lamenting on Dartmoor, well tough luck, he's to watch me having the time of my life."The Fern Britton Meets programme will broadcast on BBC One, Sunday, 27 November, at 10:00 GMT and will then be available in the UK on theBBC iPlayer.
