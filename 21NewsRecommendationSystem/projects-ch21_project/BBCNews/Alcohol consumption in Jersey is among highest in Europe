Alcohol consumption in Jersey is among highest in Europe
People in Jersey consume some of the largest amounts of alcohol in Europe, according to government figures.On average, islanders consumed the equivalent of 134 bottles of wine, or 30 bottles of spirits, a year,The Jersey Alcohol Profile 2015revealed.However, the figures showed consumption levels have reduced over the last decade.Dr Susan Turnbull, Jersey's medical officer of health, said there was "definitely no room for complacency".She said: "We are still flashing red on some of the indicators, and hazardous levels of alcohol consumption continue to take their toll on adult islanders' health."The figures, which have been published by the Public Health Directorate's Health Intelligence Unit, are based on various data, including the Jersey Annual Social Survey and hospital figures.In 2014, an average of 12 litres of pure alcohol was consumed per capita, which was similar to the level reported in 2013, but about two litres per capita less than a decade earlier, in 2004, the figures revealed.They also showed, islanders in Jersey consumed more alcohol per capita than France, Ireland, Poland and Portugal.Martin Knight, head of health improvement, said: "The report supports global evidence that fiscal measures to increase the price of alcohol, such as escalating duty, have an impact on reducing consumption."During the last decade the duty on alcohol has risen by 14%.
