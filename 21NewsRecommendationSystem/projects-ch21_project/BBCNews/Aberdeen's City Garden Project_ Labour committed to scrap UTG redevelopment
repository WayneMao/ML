Aberdeen's City Garden Project: Labour committed to scrap UTG redevelopment
The Labour Party in Aberdeen has said it will press ahead with a manifesto commitment to scrap the controversial redevelopment of Union Terrace Gardens.A referendum delivered a narrow yes vote in favour of the £140m City Garden Project to transform the gardens.Labour became the largest party at last week's election and has formed a coalition with Conservative and Independent councillors.Businessman Sir Ian Wood has put £50m behind the Granite Web design.Following a meeting with Sir Ian on Thursday, Labour said there was no change to its position.However, on Friday, Sir Ian responded that Aberdeen could not afford not to be ambitious and the chance of the project should not be missed.He said it was disappointing that the referendum decision was being challenged.In a referendum earlier this year, people were asked if they wanted to retain the gardens or back the City Garden Project redevelopment.More than 86,000 votes were cast online, by post and by phone during the referendum. There were 45,301 votes in favour of the project, with 41,175 people opposed to the plans.Tax Incremental Financing(TIF) would see a £92m loan being paid back by increased income from business rates.If it goes ahead, the project could be finished by 2017.
