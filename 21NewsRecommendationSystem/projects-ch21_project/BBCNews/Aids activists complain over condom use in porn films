Aids activists complain over condom use in porn films
The porn film industry has come under fire from Aids campaigners, who have filed a complaint against adult entertainment mogul Larry Flynt.The Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) has submitted an official complaint in California because Flynt's actors are not required to use condoms.AHF president Michael Weinstein said it was "our duty to pursue action on the issue of safety in the workplace".A spokesman for Mr Flynt said he delivered "what the consumer wants".Michael Klein, president of Larry Flynt Productions, said: "We won't budge when it comes to condomless productions."Federal law requires that all porn actors are tested for HIV 30 days before the start of filming.Mr Klein said the company adhered to those standards and that none of the actors they used had ever tested positive.The AHF said it had studied 100 films made by Mr Flynt's company and a condom was seen to be used in one single scene.It said the movies demonstrated unsafe, "potentially life-threatening" behaviour.It has submitted a complaint to California's workplace health and safety watchdog."We see it as our duty to pursue action on the issue of safety in the workplace - in these instances, unprotected sex acts taking place in albeit non-traditional workplaces," Mr Weinstein said in a statement.According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, workers in the adult film industry are 10 times more likely to be infected with a sexually-transmitted infection than members of the general public.
