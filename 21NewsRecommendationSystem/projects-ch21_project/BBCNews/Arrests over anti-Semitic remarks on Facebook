Arrests over anti-Semitic remarks on Facebook
Five men and a 15-year-old youth have been arrested in East Renfrewshire and Glasgow after anti-Semitic remarks were posted on social network site Facebook.Almost 50 police officers raided seven addresses after complaints from members of the Jewish community in Giffnock.It followed a number of offensive posts on a page entitled: "Welcome to Israel, only kidding you're in Giffnock."The six people arrested were charged with a breach of the peace with religious and racial aggravations.One other man was detained and later released without charge pending further inquiry.Ch Insp Alan Murray, of Strathclyde Police, said: "This was a very complex and protracted inquiry that required assistance from many departments of Strathclyde Police and the support of the procurator fiscal at Paisley."I hope it clearly demonstrates that Strathclyde Police will not tolerate hate crimes of any kind."It should cause anyone who believes they can get away with this sort of behaviour to think again."The Community Security Trust (CST), which helps protect the Jewish community in the UK, said: "CST welcomes the arrests of suspects regarding alleged anti-Semitic statements."Glaswegian Jews should be reassured that local police take anti-Semitism seriously, and that they are working with CST and the rest of the Jewish community in tackling it when it does arise."The spread of all types of hatred on social networking sites and similar media is a growing problem, so, it is hoped that this innovative investigation will provide a helpful precedent for all of society."
