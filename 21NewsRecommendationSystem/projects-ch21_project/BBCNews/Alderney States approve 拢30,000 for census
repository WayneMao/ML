Alderney States approve £30,000 for census
Spending the £30,000 needed to hold the first census in Alderney in more than 10 years has been agreed by the island's States.It follows concerns about the level of depopulation in the island and the current state of the economy.The proposals for a census to be held later this year were approved by eight votes to one.The Bailiwick-wide census, last held in 2001, is due to be replaced by a rolling electronic system in 2014.A previous move to introduce a census was brought in December 2011, but failed by five votes to four. A new States has since been voted in.The arguments for waiting for the rollout of the electronic census included that it would be at no additional cost to the States and it provided information more effectively, regularly and accurately.However, there has been a lot of public support for a traditional census.Neil Harvey, States member, said: "A census may not have all the answers, but is a significant step towards it."States members also unanimously agreed a major overhaul of the States pension scheme, which faces a £3.4m deficit.This was despite a petition against the plans from States workers being delivered an hour before the meeting.
