Access limited to Guernsey Airport by airfield project
Access to Guernsey Airport will be limited at the weekend due to the installation of traffic lights and removal of kerbs at its entrance.Changes to the junction are to allow greater access into the compound opposite the entrance that houses asphalt and concrete batching plants.During the work the western approach road will be closed from 06:30 BST on Saturday to 06:30 BST on Monday.A diversion will be in place along Rue du Mont Marche and Vue de L'Eglise.For traffic heading past the airport a separate diversion will be in place.Airport authorities have advised islanders to allow more time for journeys to and from the airport.Colin Le Ray, the airport director, has apologised for any inconvenience.
