Attacks on staff accounted for one in five of all violent incidents.Records from Norwich prison show that over an 18-month period there were 15 officer injuries caused by assaults by prisoners, breaking up fights or restraining inmates.In 13 of these cases their injuries led to more than three days absence from work. In one case two staff were attacked in the same incident.In Wayland prison there were five incidents reported and in Bure, one.The injuries range from loss of consciousness, fractured fingers, broken ribs, fractures to the face, whiplash and a slipped disc. Officers were also bitten, kicked, punched and head butted.
