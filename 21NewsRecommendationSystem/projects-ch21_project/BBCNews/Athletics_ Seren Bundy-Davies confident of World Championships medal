Athletics: Seren Bundy-Davies confident of World Championships medal
Welsh 400m runner Seren Bundy-Davies is confident of winning at least a bronze medal at next month's World Championships in Beijing.Bundy-Davies was named in the 4x400m relay team when theGreat Britain team was announcedon Tuesday.The 20-year-old was not considered for the individual event because she competed in the Under-23 European Championships earlier in July."I think we've got a really strong squad," she said."We finished behindAmerica and Jamaica earlier in the year in the Bahamasand we'll be looking for something similar, if not better."We're definitely capable of winning a medal."A fine season continued for Bundy-Davies on Friday when she ran apersonal best time of 51.48 secondsat the Anniversary Games in London's Olympic Stadium.In March, she won400m individual bronzeand relay silver at the European Indoor Championships.Earlier this month, she finished fourth in the individual 400m at the European Under-23 Championships in Tallinn, Estonia and helped the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team claim gold in the relay.But her decision to compete in Tallinn made her ineligible for individual 400m selection under GB's policy despite meeting the required standard. She can, however, compete in the relay and has no regrets about going to the Under-23 Championships."It was really good experience," she told BBC Wales Sport. "I think it was really important I went to the championships because I've come into athletics quite late and I think for my development over the next few years it was crucial I got a few junior competitions in."I learned a lot of valuable lessons. It was valuable experience going into the next two big years."
