Arsenal: Arsene Wenger defends David Ospina from criticism
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has defended David Ospina, describing the recent criticism of his goalkeeper as "not analysis of football".Ospina dropped a corner into his own net as Arsenal lost3-2 to Olympiakoswith Petr Cech on the bench.Tuesday's second consecutive Champions League loss leaves Wenger's side in danger of failing to reach the last 16."To kill a player like Ospina, I find that just sensationalism. This is a top, top quality player," Wenger said."If it is combined with real analysis of numbers that justify that, I will say: 'OK, they are right.' But just because one guy on the television says something, everybody says exactly the same."I don't agree with that. It makes me angry because I think it is unfair to the player."Speaking at Friday's news conference before Sunday's homematch with Manchester United,Wenger had already called the press"boring"after getting involved in a row with a journalist over team selection.
