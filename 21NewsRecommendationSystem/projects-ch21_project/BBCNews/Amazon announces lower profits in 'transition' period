Amazon announces lower profits in 'transition' period
The online retailer Amazon has announced a sharp fall in profits.Net income for the three months to the end of December was $97m (Â£61.5m), down from $177m for the same period in 2011.The fall came despite an increase in revenues during the period, from $17.43bn a year ago, to $21.27bn, a jump of 22%.That growth came as the world's largest internet retailer bagged a big share of internet spending during the crucial holiday period.In after-the-bell trading, Amazon's shares rose by close to 7%."We're now seeing the transition we've been expecting," said Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com."After five years, e-books is a multi-billion dollar category for us and growing fast - up approximately 70% last year."In contrast, our physical book sales experienced the lowest December growth rate in our 17 years as a book seller, up just 5%."We're excited and very grateful to our customers for their response to Kindle and our ever-expanding ecosystem and selection."The Seattle-based company also said operating income increased by 56% to $405m in the fourth quarter."The fourth-quarter operating income was up more than expected," said RJ Hottovy, an equity analyst at Morningstar."This supports the bull case that Amazon can monetise its growth over the longer term."
