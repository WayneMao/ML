Anger over 'namesake' candidate at Sandwell Council
The Conservatives on Sandwell Council carried out an "appalling prank" by fielding a candidate with the same name as his Labour opponent.Labour's Derek Rowley, who has been re-elected in the Great Bridge ward at Sandwell Council, claimed the Tories had tried to confuse voters."They've denied the voters of Great Bridge a credible alternative," he said.But Ray Knock, who led the Tory group, said the claim was completely untrue."This is just another load of Labour spin," he said."I take it now Labour are trying to say that just because a guy's called Derek Rowley he's got no legal right to stand."Mr Knock later lost his seat to a Labour candidate.Â· All the latest election results are available atbbc.co.uk/vote2012
