An unlikely film is generating excitement at Cannes. BBC Culture checks out a new take on the genre.
A micro-budget horror movie hasbeen called“the buzziest American film at Cannes next to Bennett Miller's wrestling drama Foxcatcher”. About a curse that is passed like a sexually transmitted disease,It Followshas captured international attention, as much for its cinematography and lyricism as for its fright factor.It’s the sign of a shift in the genre. “Horror films are booming now – I don’t think it’s just one of these quick trends,” says Wendy Mitchell, the editor of Screen International. “Audiences are really craving this kind of fun, dirty, grimy, bloody film – it’s a break from reality.”Special effects make-up artist Olivier Strecker agrees. “TV series like CSI and The Walking Dead have really opened the genre.”BBC Culture takes a look at how horror is changing and speaks from Cannes to the film-makers behind Contracted and Horsehead. “This isn’t a renewal of interest in horror as much as it is we have more quality horror films today,” says Contracted producer JD Lifshitz.“There isn’t the same kind of shame as there used to be, because they’re really bankrolling studios, they’re really crossing certain thresholds… there’s an attractiveness that didn’t necessarily exist when horror films were mostly slasher sequels or knockoffs.”If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.
