Bali drug trial: Lindsay Sandiford 'should get 15 years'
A British woman on trial for drug trafficking in Indonesia should be imprisoned for 15 years, prosecutors have told a Bali court.The maximum penalty is death, but prosecutors requested the lesser sentence for Lindsay Sandiford, 56, after taking into account her age and her co-operation during investigations.Her lawyers have asked for time to respond to the prosecution demand.A verdict is expected in early January after the next court hearing.Mrs Sandiford, from Gloucestershire, was arrested in May after Bali police found what they say was 4.8kg of cocaine in the lining of her suitcase, during a routine customs check.On Thursday in court, she listened intently to her translator as the prosecution read out its sentence demands for her.She is thought to be at the centre of the case involving three other Britons.Mrs Sandiford has repeatedly denied that she was trying to sell drugs in Bali,  insisting that she had been set up and was coerced into bringing cocaine to the island.Also on Thursday Rachel Dougall was sentenced to one year in prison for failing to report a crime.Judges said they took into consideration that she was a mother and that she co-operated with investigations.Dougall told the BBC that she was "happy" she could be with her baby, and said she will return to the UK after serving her sentence.Earlier this week  Paul Beales was sentenced to four years in prison.He was charged with possession of drugs, which carries a 12-year sentence. He was initially charged with facilitating the sale of more than 5g of drugs but prosecutors said they did not believe he was a major player and asked for a lighter sentence.The trial of Julian Ponder, accused for collecting cocaine from Mrs Sandiford, has been postponed.
