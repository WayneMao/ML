Andy Murray v Novak Djokovic: Lowdown on French Open semi
Andy Murray will attempt to end a two-year losing streak against Novak Djokovic when the pair meet inFriday's French Open semi-finals.The Briton, seeded third, faces the world number one in the second match in Paris at around 15:00 BST.Home favourite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga plays Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka in the first semi-final at 12:00.Storms and temperatures exceeding 30C are forecast to hit Roland Garros on Friday afternoon.After a settled fortnight in Paris that has seen one significant rain delay, Friday looks far more unpredictable.A temperature of 32C is forecast, with scattered thunderstorms expected from mid-afternoon."If it does get up to that temperature, it will obviously make it tougher physically and it will change the way that the court plays," said Murray, 28. "It obviously makes it quicker."That's a very, very significant difference to the beginning of the tournament. We were playing in 14, 15 degrees.""It's going to be extremely difficult, I'm aware of that," Murray made clear when asked to give his thoughts on the semi-final.The British number one has lost to the Serb at the last two Grand Slams, both times in four sets, in their 2014 US Open quarter-final and theAustralian Open finalthis year.Both matches saw Murray's challenge fade in the third and fourth sets, and the Scot added: "If I want to win the match, it's not going to be plain sailing."It's very unlikely that you'll be comfortable physically. It will be difficult, and you need to prepare yourself mentally before you go out on to the court.""I know his game," said Djokovic. "I'm going to try to prepare myself well."Djokovic appears to be a man intent on winning in Paris, the only question being whether he has peaked too early with thatstraight-sets victory overSpaniard Rafael Nadal."I'm aware that this is a big win," said the Serb. "But tomorrow is a new day and I have to move on."It's only the quarter-finals and I want to fight for the title. That's what I came here for. I have to kind of direct my thoughts to the semis."The focus of attention for those on Court Philippe-Chatrier is likely to be the first semi-final, as Tsonga continues his bid to become the first Frenchman since Yannick Noah in 1983 to win the title.His semi-final against Wawrinka has been scheduled first, after Tsonga suffered astraight-sets loss to Spaniard David Ferrerat the same stage two years ago.That match was played in an almost empty stadium as it followed anepic Nadal-Djokovic encounter,and organisers do not want Tsonga's second opportunity to be as sparsely attended."I think Wawrinka has a real chance for this title," said 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash. "He's so full of confidence,beating his hero Roger Federerin straight sets in the quarter-finals."Tsonga hasn't got a lot of 'runs on the board' this season, so I'm wondering if his legs will finally give out and the [need for] concentration will just get a bit too much for him, with the [home] fans and everything.""The numbers for Andy Murray have been very strong but it's a big call," said Mark Woodforde, Australia's 12-time Grand Slam doubles champion."It's going to be a close first set but I just think over the five-set format, Novak has shown us a whole lot more this tournament."Winning Munich and Madrid against strong player fields, Andy's arrived here in the best clay-court form. He's just beaten someone he's never beaten on clay before."It's building for Andy but, boy, he's going to have to play three sublime sets of tennis against someone who is playing at an incredibly high standard."Follow live text commentary of Friday's French Open semi-final here from 11:30 BST approx.
