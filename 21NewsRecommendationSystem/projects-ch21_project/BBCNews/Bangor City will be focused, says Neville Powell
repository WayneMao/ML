Bangor City will be focused, says Neville Powell
Bangor City manager Neville Powell says his players will treat the club's final game at Farrar Road like any other match.The Welsh Premier League champions face Prestatyn Town as the curtain falls on nearly a century of football at the ground.A number of events have been arranged to mark the final game before Bangor's move to their new Nantporth home."We can't get carried away with what's happening on the day," said Powell."We'll be focused on the football 100%. It's another massive game for us."Prestatyn will be looking for three points to cement their place in the top six. We always have a good game against them."Powell,who led Bangor to their first Welsh title in 16 years last season, spent eight years as a player at Farrar Road."Obviously it will be the last game there and it will be sad," he said."From a football point of view we must concentrate on the job in hand."We'll be doing that and then we'll look back after."I don't think it will hit us on the day that it's the last game."I think a couple of weeks later when they're knocking place down [then] I think you will feel an extra sadness."
