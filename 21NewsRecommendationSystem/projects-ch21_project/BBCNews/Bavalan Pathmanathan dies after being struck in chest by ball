He gave a thumb-up and nodded to indicate he was alright, while pressing his chest."He took a couple of steps behind the stumps and collapsed."He was such a talented and composed cricketer and a darling friend of all of us. Every one of us is going through terrible pain as a result of this terrible loss."A statement onManipay Parish Sports Club's Facebook pagesaid they were "totally shocked by his death at this young age".Surrey chief executive Richard Gould added: "Everyone at the club has been deeply saddened to learn of Bavalan's death and would like to extend their sympathies to his family, friends and everyone who knew him from within the community of cricket."A report by theFederation of International Cricketers' Associations (Fica)found last month that cricketers are as much at risk from lightning strikes, mental illness and terrorism as they are of being seriously injured by the ball.
