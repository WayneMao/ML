Armed Forces Day marked in Scotland
Parades, medal ceremonies and flypasts over three Scottish cities have been held to mark Armed Forces Day.The main celebrations centred on Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Inverness, Perth and Aberdeen on Saturday, with other events around the country.Two Typhoons from RAF Leuchars staged a flyover of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee in the early afternoon.The UK's fifth Armed Forces Day was held to show support and appreciation for the armed services.In Glasgow, Lord Provost Sadie Docherty, in her role as Lord Lieutenant, led the city's celebrations in George Square.A parade left Holland Street for George Square at lunchtime, where the Lord Provost took the salute at the march past.She said: "It is important that our serving military and our veterans know they have the support of this city and the whole of Britain."A highlight for me, as well as the march past and the music of the Royal Marines Band Scotland, is the opportunity to meet veterans and servicemen and women."The Royal Marines Band Scotland led the parade.They were followed by serving Royal Navy, Army and RAF personnel, as well as cadets from all three services and veterans.A parade was also held in Aberdeen, with participants marching along the city's Union Street.In Edinburgh, a parade was held from Kings Stable Road to Princes Street Gardens.Earlier this week, Scottish veterans of the Korean War joined Scotland Office Minister David Mundell at a reception in the Scotland Office, along with organisations including the Royal British Legion Scotland and the Korean War Veterans Association.The event was arranged to remember the sacrifices made 60 years on from the signing of the Korean War Armistice.Between 1950 and 1953 thousands of troops from Scotland formed part of a 100,000 British contingent that joined a United Nations allied force.They included personnel from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, the Black Watch, the Royal Scots, sailors who served off the Korean peninsula and several Scottish pilots from the Royal Air Force.On Friday evening, Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore presented Arctic Star medals to two veterans of the Arctic Convoys.The convoys were made up of vessels which travelled from Britain to northern Russia to resupply the Soviet Union during World War II.They delivered vital aid, running the gauntlet of enemy submarine, air and surface ship attacks. By May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels, with thousands of Allied seamen losing their lives.Mr Moore said: "Armed Forces Day is a time for us to reflect on and give thanks for those who serve our country today and who have done so in the past."It helps raise awareness of the important role they play and the sacrifices they make on our behalf and, in return, allows them to see the huge amount of public support which exists for them throughout the country."Our thoughts are also very much with those on active duty in Afghanistan and their families."Col Martin Gibson, executive chairman of Veterans Scotland, said: "Veterans throughout Scotland and the UK value the support of the public and events like this are a great way to show the esteem in which they and their service to their country is held."
