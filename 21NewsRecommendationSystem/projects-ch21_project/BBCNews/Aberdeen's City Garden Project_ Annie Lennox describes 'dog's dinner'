Aberdeen's City Garden Project: Annie Lennox describes 'dog's dinner'
Aberdeen singer Annie Lennox has described plan to transform the centre of her home town through the City Garden Project as a "dog's dinner".A full meeting of Aberdeen City Council will discuss the Union Terrace Gardens proposals on 22 August.The singer said the plan to replace the sunken gardens with the Granite Web development would be wrong.Labour want to overturn the decision of a referendum, which approved the multi-million pound City Garden Project.The former Eurythmics star said she was saddened by the "decline" of Aberdeen.Tom Smith, chairman of Aberdeen City Gardens Trust, said: "We wholly agree with Ms Lennox's views about Aberdeen's city centre."That is why we want to create an amazing new focal point that will regenerate and revitalise the whole city centre, giving us much more usable and attractive green space and amenities that can be enjoyed by everyone."What she does not seem to be aware of is that the majority of the citizens of Aberdeen have made their views known in the referendum and they want the City Garden Project to proceed."Businessman Sir Ian Wood has pledged Â£50m of his own money to the project, a project he believes the city must grasp.
