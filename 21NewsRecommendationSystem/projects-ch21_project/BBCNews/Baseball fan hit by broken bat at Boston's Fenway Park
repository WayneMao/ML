Baseball fan hit by broken bat at Boston's Fenway Park
A female fan is feared to have suffered life threatening injuries after being hit by a broken bat at a baseball game, according to a police spokeswoman.The incident occurred in Boston Red Sox's 4-2 home win over Oakland Athletics at Fenway Park on Friday.The woman was sitting with her husband and son in the second row when she was struck after Oakland Athletics' third baseman Brett Lawrie's bat shattered.The game was delayed as she received treatment before going to hospital.Oakland's Lawrie said he had been unaware that the bat - which broke as he hit a pitch in the second inning - had struck the woman."You try to keep her in your thoughts and, hopefully, everything's all right and you try to get back to the task at hand," said Lawrie.Boston manager John Farrell added:  "It's a scary moment - our concern is with her and her family."All you can think about is a family, they come to a ball game to hopefully get three hours of enjoyment, and unfortunately with how close our stands are to the field of action... an accident like this is certainly disturbing."
