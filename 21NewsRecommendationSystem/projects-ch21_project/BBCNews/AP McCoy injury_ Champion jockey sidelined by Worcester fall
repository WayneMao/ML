AP McCoy injury: Champion jockey sidelined by Worcester fall
Champion jump jockey AP McCoy will be out of competitive action until next week following a bad fall at Worcester.The 19-times champion was unshipped from the Rebecca Curtis-trained Keep Presenting in the last of his five rides at Pitchcroft on Thursday.The 40-year-old was still on the ground 15 minutes later.He was eventually able to walk to an on-course ambulance after treatment from the course's medical team, but did not suffer any serious injury.Ironically, McCoy, who suffered one of the worst injuries of his long, successful career when he broke his am at Worcester in 2003, received his latest knock in a race called the Injured Jockeys Fund 50th Anniversary Maiden Hurdle.Keep Presenting jinked badly left at the first hurdle, also bringing down the Noel Fehily-ridden St Johns Point in the process, while McCoy got a kick for his troubles."He got me good," heposted on Twitter."Feeling fairly sore this morning after my fall yesterday. Won't be back riding until after the weekend."McCoy cancelled Friday's three booked rides at Newton Abbot, where he was to be honoured in recognition of the fact that whenhe reached 4,000 career wins last November,he had ridden more of them at the Devon track than any other venue.A bronze sculpture, which will sit in the weighing room, was scheduled to be unveiled before the first race.McCoy is a regular visitor to Worcester, has had a tremendous overall record over the Pitchcroft fences this season, but the fall was the second time in less than a month that he has suffered misfortune at the track.A man was removed by security officials aftera beer can was hurled at McCoywhen he finished second on Saint Helena in the novices handicap hurdle on 19 September.
