"We've got to win our games now."With the prize being so big it's there for us and we just need to concentrate on ourselves now."We've been building our foundations on clean sheets and with the firepower we have and the form Brett Pitman is in then if we do that there is no reason why we can't win."He added: "We've never set out on this run to break any record but for any successful team you are going to do it and it is a reward and a reflection of how well we have done."
