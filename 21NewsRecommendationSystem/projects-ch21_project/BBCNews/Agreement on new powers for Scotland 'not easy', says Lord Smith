It is about agreeing on what we will do."My job is to create a process through which agreement is reached, but I cannot force â€Žan agreement."It will not be easy; it will require positive intent, courage and compromise from all parties. But I have confidence that our political leaders will rise to the challenge and I look forward to working with them."Lord Smith added that Scottish civic organisations and the wider public would get a say on the issue of more powers for the Scottish Parliament.He also announced initial details of the remit for the commission.The Smith Commission aims to get agreement between the SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Conservatives and Scottish Greens on the way forward by 30 November.A "command paper", setting out the issues, is also due to be published by 31 October, with draft legislation unveiled by 25 January.Lord Smith has asked each Scottish party to nominate two representatives to take part in the cross-party talksThe referendum saw Scotland voting to stay in the United Kingdom by 2,001,926 votes to 1,617,989 - about 55% to 45%.
