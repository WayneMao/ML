Ahly, Sunshine in six-goal thriller
Six-time winners Al Ahly of Egypt were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw by Nigeria's Sunshine Stars in their African Champions League semi-final first leg clash in Ijebu-Ode.Both teams created numerous chances and but for some good goalkeeping and the crossbar, more goals would have been recorded.Mohamed 'Gedo' Nagy put the visitors in front after 18 minutes with a superb right-foot shot from the edge of the area.El-Sayed Hamdi then doubled Ahly's advantage 12 minutes later, dinking the ball over the goalkeeper from the tightest of angles.But the home side hauled themselves back into the match four minutes later when Cameroonian midfielder, Tamen Medrano buried the ball in the top left corner of Sherif Ekramy's goal.Sunshine Stars came back for the second half with renewed purpose and got the equaliser when Olurundare Dele converted from the penalty spot.But within seconds, Gedo restored Ahly's lead when his low shot from inside the area ended up in the bottom corner of the net.There were just six minutes left on the clock when left-back Precious Osasco curled in a 25-yard free kick past Ekramy for the sixth goal of the game.The result leaves Sunshine Stars with a huge task when the second leg takes place in Cairo in a fortnight.The second leg will be played behind closed doors with the overall winners taking on either defending champions Esperance of Tunisia or TP Mazembe from the DR Congo in the final.
