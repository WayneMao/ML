Aron Gunnarsson: Midfielder wants Cardiff City momentum
Midfielder Aron Gunnarsson says a strong finish to the Championship campaign will give Cardiff City a platform to build on for next season.Cardiff, whodrew 1-1 at Reading, are unbeaten in their last four games, having lost only twice in 12 Championship games.Russell Slade's side are 13th in the table and host Bolton on Easter Monday."We have to keep the momentum and finish as high as we can, especially for next season," Gunnarsson, 25, said."It will take us into somewhere with belief and positive attitude."Hopefully we can build on that for the next season. We want to make a push forward, definitely, next season."If you finish strong, you go in to your summer and pre-season with a positive attitude and hopefully we can do that."Manager Slade hascalled for a strong finishto the campaign and has targeted a top-10 finish in the Championship.Pavel Pogrebnyak gave Reading an early lead at the Madejski Stadium, but Conor McAleny's last-minute goal secured a point for Cardiff."The positive thing about that game is we stuck to it," Gunnarsson added."We were still in the game and got the goal which we needed to keep the momentum even though it wasn't the best of games we played."We got a point away from home against a good Reading team that shouldn't be down where they are in the table."Gunnarsson returned to club duties with Cardiff having been away with Iceland, captaining the side to a 3-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win in Kazakhstan.During his time with the national team the former Coventry City player missed the birth of his first child."I was away with the national team when that happened, but I managed to see the birth of my first one on Facetime so thank God for the technology," he said."But it was an important game for Iceland and it was a mutual decision that I had to go away."But it's fine. He's sleeping okay, I'm sleeping okay so that's the good thing for the next few games."
