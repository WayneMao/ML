Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire councils launch £2.9bn city deal status bid
A bid for City Deal status worth £2.9bn has been officially launched by the leaders of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire councils.The aim is to release the funding for infrastructure in the north east of Scotland over the next 20 years.It involves a combination of government grants and borrowing powers to secure the region's economic future.Road and rail links, as well as Aberdeen Harbour, could be among the areas to benefit from funding.Jenny Laing, leader of Aberdeen City Council, said: "The Aberdeen City Region Deal considers key interventions that will maximise our opportunity for growth."Aberdeenshire Council leader Jim Gifford said: "The UK and Scottish governments have identified city regions as being one of the key engines of economic growth."By working alongside the city and our partners in the private sector, we can ensure a clear, joined-up approach to tackling pressing issues and removing barriers to allow us to achieve even more as a region."Both local authorities will discuss the matter on Thursday.In August last year,Glasgow City Council and a number of neighbouring authorities entered into an agreementwith the Holyrood and Westminster governments which would result in the funding of major infrastructure projects.
