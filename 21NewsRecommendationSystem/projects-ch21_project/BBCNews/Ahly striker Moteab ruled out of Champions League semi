Ahly striker Moteab ruled out of Champions League semi
Al Ahly striker Emad Moteab has been ruled out of the African Champions League semi-final first leg against Sunshine Stars next month.The 29-year-old is suffering from kidney stones and will not recover in time for the Egyptian side's visit to their Nigerian opponents on 6 October.Al Ahly wrote on their website: "Moteab will miss the team's trip to Nigeria as ordinary medicine failed to cure him."He will start laser treatment for his kidney pain on Tuesday."Moteab has only recently recovered from a back problem and came off the bench in Ahly's 1-1 draw with Cairo rivals Zamalek in their last Champions League group stage match.His absence is a major blow to Ahly, who have relied on Moteab's consistent performances, as they aim to build a platform to progress to the final and a shot at a seventh continental title.Tunisian side Esperance, who are the defending champions, meet TP Mazembe of DR Congo in the other semi-final.
