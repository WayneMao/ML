Probably not. But he is still going to be decent competitor and a good influence."Flintoffplayed 79 Tests, 141 limited-overs internationals and seven Twenty20sfor England between 1998 and 2009.He starred in the Ashes triumphs over Australia in 2005 and 2009, but retired the following season to end a career plagued by injuries.Flintoff - nicknamed 'Freddie' - has been training with Lancashire since March, and had hoped to be included in the Marylebone Cricket Club side to play a Rest of the World XI in July.Watkinson added: "We were on a pre-season tour in Dubai and we got a message back that 'Fred' was involved with some of the academy sessions."Then we heard he turned his arm over and he got bitten by the cricket bug again."I saw him hit some balls in the indoor centre against the bowling machine.79 Tests- 3,845 runs (average 31.77), 5 centuries, 226 wickets (average 32.78), 52 catchesHighest Test score:167 v West Indies, Edgbaston, 2004Best Test bowling:5-58 v West Indies, Barbados, 2004141 one-day internationals- 3,394 runs (average 32.01), 3 centuries, 169 wickets (average 24.38), 47 catchesHighest ODI score:123 v West Indies, 2004Best ODI bowling:5-19 v West Indies, 2009"It was at a good speed and he was really coping with it and crunching them through. I'm thinking, 'you can hit a ball here, Fred'."He has such a good physique and the class with bat and ball shone through. It has developed from there really."Flintoff is set toplay for former club St Annesagainst Penrith in the Northern League on Saturday.St Annes captain Andy Kellett said: "It will be a bit weird for me being captain of the side when there is a former England captain in the side, but I have done it before."We don't know how much we will use him against Penrith and we will discuss that after he arrives at the ground on Saturday."Listen to Andrew Flintoff's full interview with former England team-mate Steve Harmison on BBC Radio 5 live Sport from 19:00 BST.
