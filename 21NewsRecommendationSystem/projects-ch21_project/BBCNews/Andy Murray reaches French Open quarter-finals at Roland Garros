Andy Murray reaches French Open quarter-finals at Roland Garros
Media playback is not supported on this deviceAndy Murray held his nerve to beat France's Jeremy Chardy and reach his fifth French Open quarter-final.The Scot, seeded third, came back from a break down in the third set to win 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-2 in two hours and 51 minutes.He goes on to face seventh seed David Ferrer, who beat ninth seed Marin Cilic 6-2 6-2 6-4.Murray, 28, has now won all 14 clay-court matches he has played in 2015."I wasn't overly concerned," he said. "I had a lot of chances in the second set."He had one break point, which he obviously won, but throughout the course of the match I was creating many more opportunities than him."I just had to take my chances when they came. I did that in the third and fourth sets."It is five years since Murray fell before the quarter-finals at a Grand Slam and nine years since he lost to a lower-ranked player than Chardy, the world number 45.However, with the home crowd behind him on the raucous Court Suzanne Lenglen, Chardy threatened to cause a major upset as he levelled at one set all and broke early in the third.The 28-year-old from Pau had only won one of his seven previous matches against Murray though, and 10 double-faults - several at key moments - particularly damaged his cause.After breaks of serve were swapped in the first two games, Murray pumped his fist as he finished one terrific rally at the net on his way to moving 3-2 ahead.The Briton had the contest in his grasp early in the second only for Chardy to fend off five break points, and urged on by the crowd he began to dictate.A brilliant backhand return gave him an unexpected break for 3-1 and he saw out the set with 17 winners as Murray struggled to contain him.Another backhand winner put Chardy a break up at the start of the third but his lead lasted only a few minutes, as a double-fault, a smash into the net and two loose groundstrokes handed it straight back.With Murray relentlessly pressing on the return, the Frenchman offered up a ninth double fault to fall 5-3 behind and his hopes were slipping away fast.Some breathtaking defensive work helped Murray grab the initiative early in the fourth and he broke three times to secure his 17th consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final place."Unfortunately, I'm playing against guys that make some of the things I have done look pretty average because of how good they have been," said Murray."But in terms of the history of the game, there are not loads of players that have been that consistent at these events."That's something that I look at and I'm very, very proud of."
