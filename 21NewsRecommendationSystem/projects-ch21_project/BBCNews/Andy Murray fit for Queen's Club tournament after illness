Andy Murray fit for Queen's Club tournament after illness
Britain's Andy Murray is ready to begin his grass-court campaign at Queen's Club next week after recovering from a bout of illness.Murray, 28, said he suffered with a cough during the French Open and his left eye later closed up.The Scot lost to Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals last Saturday, and took three days off on returning to the UK."I was actually sick for about a week, so I needed to recover from that," world number three Murray said."I actually felt OK the first few days, but the day I played David Ferrer, I didn't feel great."When I got on court and started running around it was fine, but when I got back my left eyelid closed up."I had a bad cough for a couple of days after that as well."I don't know if I was just run down or tired or whatever, but it had obviously been a long few weeks. I feel fine now."Murray confirmed that coach Amelie Mauresmo, who is due to give birth in August, will be with him at Wimbledon, with Swede Jonas Bjorkman taking oncoaching dutiesat Queen's."I would imagine that during Wimbledon Amelie would kind of take the lead and Jonas can see how we operate a bit more as a team," he said.Thedefeat by Djokovicended a 15-match winning run for Murray on clay, and the two-time major winner now switches his attention to trying to match the likes of John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick by winning a fourth title at Queen's Club.Top seed Murray will play a qualifier in round one of the Aegon Championships, with the match likely to take place on Tuesday.The tournament carries ATP 500 status for the first time this year, upgraded from 250, and takes place a week later, creating a gap after Roland Garros.Five of the world's top 10 players are in London for the Wimbledon warm-up.Second seed Stan Wawrinka, fresh from winning theFrench Openlast Sunday, will play Nick Kyrgios - the Australian whobeat Rafael Nadalat Wimbledon last year - in round one.Kyrgios, 20, described Wawrinka's tennis in Paris last week as "extraordinary", adding: "Every time I'm here, it's hard not to think about what happened last year."I'd like to think I've done a lot of good things since then as well, which have also boosted my confidence."Fifth seed Nadal returns to Queen's Club for the first time since 2011 and plays Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov, whiledefending championand sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov opens against former champion Sam Querrey.British number four James Ward will play Canada's third seed Milos Raonic on Monday.
