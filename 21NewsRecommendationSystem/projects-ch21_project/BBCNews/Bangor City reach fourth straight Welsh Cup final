Bangor City reach fourth straight Welsh Cup final
Neville Powell's incredible unbeaten Welsh Cup run continued as his Bangor City side reached the Welsh Cup final for the fourth successive season.A superb Chris Jones effort seven minutes from time gave the holders a 1-0 semi-final victory over Connah's Quay Nomads at Rhyl's Belle Vue ground.The other semi-final was also settled by a late goal as Chris Venables gave Llanelli a 1-0 win over The New Saints.Venables kept his cool to slot home after a one-two with Jordan Fellows.Craig Jones wasted the best chance for the Saints, who were unbeaten in all competitions since October, when he fired over the bar from eight yards with only the goalkeeper to beat.The results sets up a replay of the 2007/08 final, won 4-2 by Bangor after extra time, giving Powell his first of three triumphs in the competition.Powell has now won all 22 Welsh Cup ties with Bangor since joining the north Wales club in May 2007.The final will be played at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli on Sunday, 8 May (1430 BST).
