Andy Swiss reports on new whip rules for Jockeys
Andy Swiss reports on tough new rules on how often a jockey can use a whip during a race that are being brought in.The British Horseracing Authority has spent five months speaking to riders, trainers, vets and animal welfare groups. They've now halved the number of times a whip can be used.The rules come in on 10 October and will include stiff penalties for jockeys that contravene them. Some critics wanted to see horses disqualified but the BHA doesn't want to to penalise racehorse owners, trainers and stable staff.Available to UK users only.
