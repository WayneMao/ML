Aberystwyth's damaged public shelter to be repaired
A Grade II-listed public shelter which was badly damaged during the recent storms should be repaired, said Welsh historical monuments body Cadw.The 1920s building on Aberystwyth prom has partly fallen into a hole after its foundations were washed away.Ceredigion council said it would try to move the shelter by lifting it in one piece during the next week.Cadw has told the council it wants the shelter to be repaired and replaced in its current position.In 2010 Ceredigion Council proposed to replace the two public shelters on the prom with new ones at a cost of Â£60,000.At the time the council said the shelter damaged this week near Bath Rock was becoming too costly to repair.But the plan to replace it was scrapped in 2011 after it was made a Grade II-listed building by Cadw.
