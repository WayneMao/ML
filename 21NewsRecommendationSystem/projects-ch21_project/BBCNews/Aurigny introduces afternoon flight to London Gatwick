Aurigny introduces afternoon flight to London Gatwick
Guernsey airline Aurigny is introducing an additional weekday flight to London.From 1 February the company is putting on an extra afternoon flight to London Gatwick, leaving at 1630.There will be a return service to Guernsey at 1800, with the last return flight from Gatwick moved from 1920 to 1930.Malcolm Coupar, Aurigny's commercial director, believes the service will prove popular with the business community."Being able to have the right work-life balance is very important for many Guernsey business travellers," Mr Coupar said."Many will want to have a day's work in the London office but still get home in time to put their children to bed or go to a social event."The introduction of an 1800 departure from Gatwick will make this possible and they will no longer have to choose between a shorter working day or arriving home after the children have gone to sleep."Mr Coupar said Aurigny recognised the air links with Gatwick were of vital importance.Last week the States-owned airline said it had no plans to "alienate" passengers by introducing luggage charges.
