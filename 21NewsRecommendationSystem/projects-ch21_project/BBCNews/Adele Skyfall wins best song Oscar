Adele Skyfall wins best song Oscar
Adele has won the Oscar for best original song for Skyfall, the first Oscar for a Bond film in 47 years.The film, part of a franchise which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, was also joint winner in the sound editing category.Skyfall, which failed to top the official UK singles chart, also becomes the first Bond theme to win an Oscar.Asked how she would celebrate her win, the 24-year-old new mum replied: "One glass of champagne and I'm gone."Choking back tears, Adele thanked her co-writer and producer, Paul Epworth for "believing in me all the time", then paid tribute to her husband Simon Konecki, who she called "my man"."Thank you so much, this is amazing," she added.During their Oscar interview, the pairrevealedthat they wrote first draft of the song "in 10 minutes, but there was way more to come".Adele had earlier given her first ever live performance of the 23rd Bond song in front of a packed Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.As she stepped off the stage, Adele kicked off her sparkly Louboutin platform shoes. "I'd pick them up but I can't bend over," she said, motioning toward her tight beaded dress.Speaking to the singer backstage, BBC entertainment reporter Emma Saunders told the star she had been missed at last week's Brit awards."I missed it too, I just didn't want to fly back with my baby," she said.Asked how she planned to celebrate after the ceremony, Adele added: "I think I'm going to the Vanity Fair party, so that'll be quite nice. But I've got to get up at 6am so one glass of champagne and I'm gone these days."Then, in an echo of her appearance at last year's Brits, her post-awards press conference performance was interrupted to welcome the sound editing winners to the stage.The awards moderator later apologised for the interruption.When asked if they recorded the song in 10 minutes, Adele said: "It was two studio sessions. It was a bit longer than that. We're good but we're not that good. Sorry."While Skyfall missed out on a number one in the official UK singles chart, the track topped the iTunes chart within 10 hours of being released on 5 October 2012.Epworth said the "dark and moody" song was intended to echo the narrative of the film."The [Bond theme] songs seem to fall into groups, in terms of subject matter," said Epworth. "Some of them have a romanticism to them, and some of them are very much about the narrative of the film."The 23rd Bond film, Skyfall - Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 - was released in UK cinemas on 26 October.There was a special honour for the Bond franchise during Sunday's Oscar ceremony, as the British super-spy celebrated his 50th anniversary on the big-screen in 2012 with Skyfall.The tribute, introduced by Halle Berry who starred as a Bond girl in Die Another Day (2002), included a stellar performance from Shirley Bassey, who received a standing ovation for her performance of her theme song to the 1960s Bond tale Goldfinger.The other nominees in the 2013 best song category were Before My Time from Chasing Ice; Everybody Needs a Best Friend from Ted; Pi's Lullaby from Life of Pi; and Suddenly from Les Miserables.Thunderball was the last Bond film to pick up an Oscar, winning in the sound effects category in 1965.
