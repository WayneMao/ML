Angela Wrightson: Teen girls 'beat woman to death'
A woman suffered more than 100 injuries after she was beaten to death by two teenage girls using items including a shovel and a TV, a court heard.Angela Wrightson's half-naked body was found by her landlord at her home in Hartlepool on 9 December 2014.A wooden stick laced with screws, a coffee table and a computer printer were also used in the attack, Leeds Crown Court heard.Two girls, aged 13 and 14 at the time, have denied murder.Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC said Ms Wrightson, 39, a known alcoholic with a "troubled history", was repeatedly beaten in the living room of her home by the teenagers.Jurors were told the girls battered their victim in "a sustained and brutal attack" with a variety of implements including a kettle and glass ornaments.Both the defendants, who are now aged 14 and 15, were in the care of social services at the time of the attack, the court heard. Neither of them can be identified because of their ages.Mr Campbell said the girls' friendship had "caused concern" to those caring for them and they were known to run away together.The older girl accepts that she struck Ms Wrightson but said she did not intend to do her serious harm.The younger girl denies any part in the assault and says she did not encourage her co-accused in any way.Mr Campbell said: "The relationship between the two was close, even intense."A message recovered from the younger girl to the older girl in October 2014 said: "We're not allowed no contact with each other. Who's not allowed no contact with each other?"We will be with each other through thick and thin!! Just because you're my little partner in crime."The jury was told Ms Wrightson was "well-liked when sober" and would give chocolates to young children.But she could be "difficult" when drunk and was known to police and social services, who once found her lying in the middle of the road, the prosecution said.The court was told the girls let themselves in through Ms Wrightson's unlocked door at 19:15 on 8 December and began taking selfies.Ms Wrightson was last seen alive returning home from her local shop just after 19:30.Jurors heard the violence had started by 21:00 and the younger girl took selfies of the defendants smiling with Ms Wrightson pictured in the background.Mr Campbell said she was "alive but not smiling and her face is marked".The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, continues.
