Angel Rangel hails impact of Swansea new boys
Defender Angel Rangel believes Swansea's summer recruits have played a major role in the club's perfect start to the season.Swansea followed on from their opening day win overQPRtobeat West Ham 3-0and maintain their 100% start.New signings Michu, Jonathan de Guzman and Chico have all played in the two Premier League victories."The signings from the gaffer have made a difference so far," Rangel said.Michu joined the Swansea from Rayo Vallecano while Dutchman de Guzman will spend the season on loan from Villarreal.Spanish defender Chico joined from Italian club Genoa, having played for Swansea boss Michael Laudrup at Real Mallorca during a loan spell in Spain's top division.And Rangel believes all three have settled in at Swansea and are suited to the Welsh side's style of play."They've all come from a league in Spain that they all know to keep the ball," added Rangel."Their strength is their quality on the ball and they're very intelligent on the pitch as well and I think this is making the difference for us."Michu has had a great start, scoring three goals in two games. And Chico at the back is looking very solid."Media playback is not supported on this deviceRangel scored Swansea's opening goal in their 3-0 win over West Ham with further goals from Michu and Danny Graham sealing an impressive display.And full-back Rangel agrees with manager Laudrup that Swansea should not get carried away despite their perfect start to the season.Following victories over QPR and West Ham the Swans face Barnsley in the League Cup on Tuesday before hosing Sunderland in the Premier League next Saturday."We all know it's early days. We have to keep going - it's only six points. We know we are still far away from safety," Rangel says."But it's good to see the team performing well and winning games. This is going to give us so much confidence for the next games.The Catalan-born defender says Laudrup has tweaked Swansea's approach to games since succeeding Brendan Rodgers during the summer."We don't keep the possession as much as last season but we're creating so many chances and scoring goals," he said."And at the other end we're not conceding. The team are looking solid, which is what the gaffer wants."I think everyone is enjoying so far."
