Bayern Munich hit nine past Hamburg to move closer to title
German side Bayern Munich produced a sensational performance to thrash Hamburg 9-2 and take another step towards becoming Bundesliga champions.Claudio Pizarro scored four for Bayern, while another ex-Chelsea player Arjen Robben grabbed two in the romp.The Bavarians would have sealed the title with that win had Borussia Dortmund failed to defeat Stuttgart - but the defending champions won 2-1.Bayern need just two more points from the last seven games to seal the title.The German giants have 72 points, 20 more than Dortmund, who were handed victory in Stuttgart thanks to Robert Lewandowski's late winner.What made Bayern's 9-2 victory all the more remarkable was that key players David Alaba, Thomas Muller, Franck Ribery, Mario Gomez and Mario Mandzukic, were all rested with the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final match against Juventus on Tuesday.It was the fourth time Bayern have scored nine goals in one match. Borussia Monchengladbach still hold the record for the biggest win which was a whopping 12-0 victory Borussia Dortmund in 1978.
