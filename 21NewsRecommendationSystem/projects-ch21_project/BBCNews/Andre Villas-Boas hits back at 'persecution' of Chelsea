Media playback is not supported on this deviceAndre Villas-Boas said Chelsea gave their critics a "slap in the face" by reaching the Champions League knockout phase with victory over Valencia.The Portuguese manager was speaking afterthe 3-0 win, claiming there had been "persecution" of the Blues during their recent indifferent run."My players deserve respect they don't get," said Villas-Boas."We've been chased by different kinds of people and pressures. Here we have given everyone a slap in the face."The crucial win over Valencia was only Chelsea's fifth in their last 11 matches but it was enough to ensure the Blues topped Group E ahead of German outfit Bayer Leverkusen, who could only draw at Genk.It is unfortunate for you guys [the media] because you have to report on a brilliant win for ChelseaAnd Villas-Boas took the opportunity to hit out at the media's coverage of the London team.He feels that Premier League leaders Manchester City have not been under the same pressure - even though they could exit the Champions League at the group stage,having lost to Napoli.Villas-Boas said: "It [the coverage] has been over the top."I hope they [Manchester City] qualify for the Champions League knockout stage but the attitude to them is; if they qualify they qualify, if they don't they don't - we don't get that margin."Villas-Boas was particularly unhappy at comments from former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville in the build-up to the match.He added: "We see a [former] Manchester United defender [Neville] say in the preparations for the game things like, 'I don't want to be one of the Chelsea players today, I couldn't play this game and it is a difficult game for them'."This is out of this world for me, I don't believe this. This is a continuous persecution, it is aggression towards one club."It is unfortunate for you guys [the media] because you have to report on a brilliant win for Chelsea and we qualify first in the group. It is difficult for everybody and today this is difficult for you."Full Champions League tablesVillas-Boas was elated that Chelsea not only qualified with two goals from Didier Drogba and another from Ramires - but topped the group."Finishing top of the group is fantastic," he added. "It is against all odds. Nobody would have put a bet on us finishing top but it has happened and it is very satisfying."The team was excellent. It was a win of human values, team spirit, solidarity, responsibility, strength of character, resilience, ability to take criticism."Chelsea now await the draw for the last 16 on Friday, 16 December.For updates and breaking sports news throughout the day, followSportsday Live.
