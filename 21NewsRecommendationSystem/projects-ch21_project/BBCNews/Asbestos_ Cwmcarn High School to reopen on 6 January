Asbestos: Cwmcarn High School to reopen on 6 January
A south Wales school which closed more than a year ago after the discovery of asbestos will reopen in the new year.Pupils will return to Cwmcarn High School in Caerphilly county on 6 January after safety work is completed.They were supposed to go back in September but the death of a contractor prevented their return.The school has been operating from a former Coleg Gwent campus 12 miles (19km) away in Ebbw Vale since November 2012.Teachers will spend the final three weeks of term preparing for the move back to Cwmcarn.It had previously been thought that some pupils may have been able to return before Christmas.In a statement on the school's website, the chairman of governors Gary Thomas said the school would try to minimise disruption to pupils.He said: "As you can imagine, the task of moving an entire school, once again, is an enormous undertaking for both the employees of Caerphilly council and the staff of Cwmcarn High School."Most importantly, we will be making every effort to avoid disruption to the everyday running of the school and the learning experience of our pupils, especially those facing vital examinations in Years 11, 12 and 13."The school closed in October 2012 over worries its 900 pupils were at risk when asbestos was found. Contractors were brought in to remove it.In July, James Paul, 26, from Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, was working in a suspended ceiling space when he died.It is thought he may have been electrocuted.
