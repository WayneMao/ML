Andy Murray to forget Djokovic record in French Open clash
Andy Murray goes into Friday's French Open semi-final against Novak Djokovic in confident mood despite recent losses to the Serb.The Briton beat David Ferrer 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 5-7 6-1 to claim one of his best clay-court wins on Wednesday.Murray is unbeaten in 15 matches on the surface this year, but has lost his last seven against Djokovic."My job is to forget about what's happened in the past and focus on that match," the Scot told BBC Sport."I need to come up with the best game plan possible to win against him."Djokovic, the world number one, became only the second man ever to beat Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros on Wednesday, extending his own winning streak to 27 matches.The 28-year-old top seed is trying to win the only major title to have eluded him and so complete the career Grand Slam."He's obviously played great tennis. His win against Rafa in straight sets is obviously very impressive," added Murray.The Scot is a two-time semi-finalist in Paris, losing to Nadal in 2011 and 2014, but has won his first two titles on clay in the past month, which included a win over Nadal in Madrid."I think the matches that I played in Madrid and some of the tennis I've played here, it's obviously the best I've played on clay," said Murray."I'd never won against David before, I'd never won against Rafa before, I'd never beaten Kei Nishikori, Milos Raonic."I'll take the confidence of the last few weeks into the match against Novak on Friday."Murray's last win over Djokovic was in the 2013 Wimbledon final, and he has lost to the Serb three times this year.However, they have only met twice before on clay, and not since 2011."Obviously he's the best player in the world this year, one of the best players on clay for the last few years as well," added Murray."It's going to be extremely difficult, I'm aware of that. I have to look at all the positives of the last few weeks and months."I'm playing way better tennis than I was this time last year. Physically, I feel much better."
