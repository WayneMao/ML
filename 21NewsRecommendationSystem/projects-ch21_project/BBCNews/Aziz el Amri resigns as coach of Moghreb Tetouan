Aziz el Amri resigns as coach of Moghreb Tetouan
Aziz el Amri stepped down as coach of Moroccan side Moghreb Tetouan following their disappointing showing at the Fifa Club World Cup.The 64 year old resigned three days after Tetouan lost on penalties to Auckland City of New Zealand in a play-off for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition.Amri had led Tetouan to two Moroccan titles in the last three seasons, withthe last triumph seeing them qualify for the Club World Cupas champions of the host nation.Despite the backing of more than 40,000 supporters for the match against Auckland in Rabat, Tetouan fell at the first hurdle in their attempt to match Raja Casablanca's run to the final of last year's competition, whenthey were eventually beaten by Bayern Munich.The pressure on Tetouan had been all the greater after Moroccans had hoped the hosting of the event would help make up for the country's refusal to stage the Africa Cup of Nations early in the New Year due to fears over the spread of Ebola.Instead of Tetouan,Auckland will face African champions Entente Setif of Algeriain Saturday's quarter-final.The winners of that match will face San Lorenzo of Argentina, Copa Libertadores holders, in the semi-final next week.
