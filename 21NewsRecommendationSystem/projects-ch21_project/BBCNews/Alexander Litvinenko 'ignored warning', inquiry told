Alexander Litvinenko 'ignored warning', inquiry told
Alexander Litvinenko brushed off warnings about possible threats to his life hours before he was poisoned, the inquiry into his death has heard.Witness Mario Scaramella said he had warned the Russian ex-spy that they were both at risk.But Mr Litvinenko seemed more focused on eating his food, he said.Mr Litvinenko consumed tea laced with polonium-210 later that day, 1 November 2006, the inquiry was told. He died in hospital three weeks later.The 43-year-old had been an officer with the Federal Security Service (FSB) - the successor to the KGB - but fled to Britain where he became a fierce critic of the Kremlin.Mr Scaramella said he first met Mr Litvinenko in late 2003 after his appointment as an adviser to an inquiry into Soviet intelligence set up in his home country, Italy.He learned of a specific threat to himself and Mr Litvinenko via an email in early October 2006, and flew to London the day before the Russian fell ill, he said.The pair arranged to meet in Piccadilly and went to a sushi restaurant."We started to talk about general issues and then I said 'let's talk seriously,' he said."He was more focused about his food than the email."I was saying 'This is a serious issue'. He said 'I have to check'."Mr Scaramella said he told Mr Litvinenko: "Someone is following me and looking to kill me, and the same is about you."The Italian said he was "stressed" by the situation and wrote a note to security services and police in case he was found poisoned.Mr Litvinenko, 43, consumed tea laced with radioactive chemical polonium while meeting Russians Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square, London, later that day.The pair have been identified as the prime suspects in the killing of Mr Litvinenko.Both men deny any involvement and remain in Russia. The public inquiry continues at the Royal Courts of Justice.
