Battersea Power Station fire fear after TV stunt
Firefighters were called to Battersea Power Station after a TV stunt caused concerns the historic building was alight.Flames were projected on to the Grade II*-listed building in south-west London to promote explorer Bear Grylls' new show on the Discovery Channel.London Fire Brigade said it was called at 19:50 BST and realised it was a false alarm on reaching the site.The 39-acre site is to be turned into 3,500 homes, offices, shops and a park.As part of the stunt, the TV presenter abseiled down the building as flames came up from the ground.A fire service spokesman said: "We attended and as soon as we got there we realised it wasn't an incident for us."But we take every call seriously."A Malaysian consortium is redeveloping the site and restoring the building, and it will take at least 10 years to complete the Â£8bn project.The building, known for its four chimneys, has been vacant since being decommissioned in 1983 and is on English Heritage's at risk register.
