An ode to the Olympics
The London 2012 Olympic Games are coming to end on Sunday with what organisers promise to be a spectacular closing ceremony at the Olympic Stadium.The motto of the Games is, 'inspire a generation'. What aspect of the Games has inspired you?The success of London 2012 has been uplifting for many people. BBC News website readers have been inspired to compose these poems:Watching the Olympics at home on my TVCouldn't get a ticket, wasn't meant to beIt doesn't really matter have enjoyed it just the sameSo many screens to choose fromMaking my Olympic Games.My lounge has been a stadium,In sea, on sand, in poolA velodrome, a football pitchWhat is the offside rule?So many sporting delights to watchIn our green and pleasant landShowing off its beautyWith such pride we can all standUnited as a nationBritain rules the wavesThank you so much BBCA blinder you have played.They said we won't be readyThey said it's doomed to failThey said we'll never cope with itThere'll be chaos on road and railNow two weeks on it's all but doneThe Olympic torch is spentSo let's look back on the last two weeksAnd see just how it went:First we had the torch relayRoads lined with passionate BritsA hint of something special perhapsRunners in bright white kits.A tour around the countryTo invoke the Olympic dreamOur thoughts begin to turnTo our Olympic team.Then we had the openingA wonderful affairA history of our IslandWith music, dance and flairThe countries then paradedThe stadium soon filledThe Olympic Oath was takenThe very air seemed stilled.The greatest athletes in the worldAll gathered in one placeEach one hoping to win a goldIn their event or raceThen 16 days of wonder,Each athlete giving their allThe sweat, the pain, the tearsIn search of their ultimate goalTeam GB are in their strideThe medals start to mountOur hearts begin to fill with prideAs we watch the medal countFarrah, Murray, EnnisSurely Britain at its bestMckeever, Wiggins, HoyEach pass the ultimate testA truly great OlympicsThe best we've ever seenA nation now unitedBy our own Olympic dream.But now it's almost overThe Olympic games are spentI wonder if we'll look back and wonderWhere the pessimists went?Exhaustion and ache and early dawn break;a track to pound,  a circuit to round, new strengths to be foundIn rain, fog and storm, rise up from the warm;tasks to complete, seconds to beat, new personal featHours alone, longing for home;a life on hold, a force unfold, a time to be boldA sense of right, the challenge to fight;with sabres, with bow, with paddles to rowA relentless drive, the will to thrive;a timely skill, a handstand still,  a dive to thrillFrom finish line sights and equine heights;a race to be run, a hammer spun, a clear round wonBut when each of them strive, who can measure the driveof those destined to hold,  these medals tri-fold ; Bronze, Silver, and Gold.This Isle of Wonder,Majestic in its glory;United amongst its people,Witnessing a storyTo be passed down to the next generation;The pride of a nation,Joined together through a single flame,The heart of the Olympic games.This Isle of Wonder,On which heroes have been born and bred;To whom our hearts have been lifted,And our tears have been shed;Must herald the dawn of a new age of aspiration,To be handed down to the next generation.For never in our minds should we erase,The spectacle that every single Olympian gave,To this Isle of Wonder,And to the World that has seen,The greatest sportspeople on earth,Fight for all they ever dreamed.This is the stuff to inspire each next generation,Long after the Games fade in their celebration.For together we witnessed the greatest show on Earth,And greater than gold has this show been worth.
