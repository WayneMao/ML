Avon and Somerset Police appoints second temporary chief
A second temporary chief constable for Avon and Somerset has been appointed following Nick Gargan's suspension and calls for his resignation.Gareth Morgan replaces John Long, who had headed up the force since Mr Gargan was suspended in May 2014 but retired on Monday.Mr Gargan was urged to quit last month after being found guilty of eight counts of misconduct in July.Despite the verdict, the 48-year-old was cleared to resume his duties.However, with mounting pressure from senior police officers wanting a change at the top, he was later told to quit by the force's police and crime commissioner, Sue Mountstevens.While that legal process continues, Mr Morgan has been brought in."I recognise the trust that has been placed in me to undertake the role of temporary chief constable," he said."I came to Avon and Somerset nearly a year ago and every day during this time I have seen outstanding officers and staff serving their communities in the finest traditions of British policing, doing their very best in often difficult and challenging circumstances."It is a privilege to lead these men and women as I take on this new role and I remain determined to keep the public at the forefront of all that we do."His support team will include Assistant Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe who has been temporarily promoted to temporary deputy chief constable and Ch Supt Kay Wozniak who will join the chief officer group as temporary assistant chief constable for specialist operations.
