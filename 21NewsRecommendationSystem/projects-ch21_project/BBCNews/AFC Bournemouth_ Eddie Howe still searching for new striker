AFC Bournemouth: Eddie Howe still searching for new striker
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says he is still targeting a new striker, despite Josh McQuoid returning to add to his attacking options.McQuoid suffered a knee injury in pre-season, but has now recovered and is in contention for the squad for Saturday's Championship game at Huddersfield.However, Howe says his search for extra firepower up front goes on."We're really pleased with the four we have, but if we can find another one to add, we will," Howe toldBBC Solent.The Cherries also have Wes Thomas, Brett Pitman and Lewis Grabban as well as McQuoid, but Howe is keen to strengthen further."Josh coming back to fitness has given us a boost," he said. "We now have four strikers although Josh is not match-fit yet."But we are still looking. You really do need that strength in depth in that position because they make the difference and define your season."
