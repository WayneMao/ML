Barcelona consider leaving Nou Camp
Barcelona will make a decision in January on whether to expand their Nou Camp stadium or move to a new location.The Spanish club want to increase the capacity of Europe's largest football stadium from 99,354 to 105,000, and build a roof to cover the ground.Barcelona's board of directors will vote on the plan early in the new year.Board spokesman Toni Freixa said: "We've made advances, we have all the information and we're in a position to make a decision."The iconic Nou Camp has been the home of Barcelona since 1957 and has hosted two European Cup finals - in 1989 and 1999 - the World Cup in 1982 and the Olympic football tournament in 1992.Friexa said while one option would see the construction of a new stadium on ground currently belonging to the University of Barcelona, the other project involved a "profound remodelling" of the existing stadium.He added: "Both would have a capacity of 105,000 spectators, the stadium would be covered."It needs to be viable from a technical perspective, urbanist and economic. We would never submit a project that would endanger the sustainability of the club."
