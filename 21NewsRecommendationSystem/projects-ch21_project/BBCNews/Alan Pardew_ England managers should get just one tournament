Alan Pardew: England managers should get just one tournament
England should appoint a manager on a tournament-by-tournament basis, Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says.Pardew, 54, is considered one of the favourites to replace Roy Hodgson when the 68-year-old vacates the post."I don't know about 'the favourite' but it's a job I have specific views on," Pardew toldthe Times."If you have one of the biggest jobs in the world, which England manager is, you take it for one tournament. If you don't succeed, it's over."Hodgson wasappointed England managershortly before Euro 2012 and took the team to the quarter-finals where they lost on penalties to Italy, but at the World Cup last year they failed to win a game and wereknocked out in the group stagefor the first time since 1958.Hodgson remained in charge and his team qualified for Euro 2016 with a 100% record from their 10 matches. Hiscontract expiresafter next year's tournament in France.His predecessor, Fabio Capello, had four years in charge, winning 28 of his 42 matches, with one World Cup campaign in which England were eliminated in the first knockout round by Germany."I might be misguided but if Roy doesn't do well at the Euros, they should move him on, give it to somebody and say: 'Here's your tournament, win it'," Pardew said.The former Palace midfielder, who has managed six English teams, said of the national team job: "To give yourself the best chance the manager should be tournament by tournament."You're not building anything, you're picking an instant best team to win a championship. How long have you got to work with them? Three training days every three months?"
