Alcohol Concern Cymru in Welsh assembly drink laws call
Alcohol campaigners are calling for the Welsh Assembly Government to be given the powers to set minimum prices for drink.Alcohol Concern Cymru is issuing a manifesto to political parties ahead of the assembly elections in May.It wants a minimum price of 50p per unit of alcohol, which is part of its proposals for a healthier future for Wales.The assembly government does not comment on manifestos.Alcohol Concern said it was not an anti-alcohol organisation.Its policy manager in Wales, Andrew Misell said: "We believe alcohol can play an enjoyable and important part in our culture and society."However, with alcohol-related harm continuing to rise, we believe that smarter policies are needed to ensure Wales has a healthier relationship with alcohol."Setting a price of 50p per unit of alcohol would reduce consumption to reasonable levels, said Alcohol Concern Cymru.
