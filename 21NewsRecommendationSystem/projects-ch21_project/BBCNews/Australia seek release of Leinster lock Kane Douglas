Australia seek release of Leinster lock Kane Douglas
Australia have asked Leinster to release forward Kane Douglas for the Rugby Championship and the World Cup.Leinster team manager Guy Easterby said the club had received a formal request from the Wallabies on Friday.Easterby said he was "delighted" for the 26-year-old, wishing him well as he "seeks the form and fitness required".The Wallabies sought the release of the 14-cap lock under a World Rugby rule that states clubs must release players during approved Test windows.But Douglas is well short of the60-cap thresholdset by the Australian Rugby Union for players to be eligible for the Wallabies while based overseas.The Rugby Championship runs from 17 July-8 August, with the World Cup starting on 18 September.Easterby also revealed Douglas's Leinster team-mate Zane Kirchner is in the initial South Africa squad.He said: "It reflects positively on Leinster when we have players selected for national squads."We have been in discussions with the Australian Rugby Union and with Kane for a few weeks now and we have made our position clear."Kane is contracted to Leinster for another two seasons and we look forward to welcoming him back when his commitments with the ARU come to an end."
