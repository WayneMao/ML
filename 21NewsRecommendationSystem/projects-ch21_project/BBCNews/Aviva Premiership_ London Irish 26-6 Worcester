For our forwards, it was their best of the season, especially after being routed up at Northampton."We've got four games remaining now and we've not been looking over our shoulder all season."We are a real handful at home and, if we can win those last four games, there's no reason why we can't finish as high as eighth."Worcester director of rugby Richard Hill:"At home we're a completely different side. We're working hard to find a solution to the problem with our away form. I'm sorry for our supporters but we've tried almost everything and are finding it a difficult problem to crack."On a cold and wet day like this you need your forwards to take control. They didn't and we had no answers to their driving maul, with their half-backs kicking far more accurately than ours."We had numerous opportunities five metres from their try-line but failed to take any of them. They had probably fewer chances than us but were clinical in taking them."London Irish:Homer; Ojo, Armitage, Geraghty, Yarde; Humphreys, Phibbs; Lahiff, Paice, Aulika, Skivington (capt), Evans, Garvey, Treviranus, Hala'ufia.Replacements:Halavatau for Aulika (56), Moates for Phibbs (60), Joseph for Paice (60), Fisher for Hala'ufia (61), Tagicakibau for Armitage (68), Gibson for Treviranus (70).Not Used:Lawson, Yanuyanutawa.Worcester:Pennell; Drauniniu, Grove, Clarke, Lemi; Goode, Hodgson; Mullan, Shervington, Andress, Percival (capt), Schofield, Best, Kvesic, Cowan.Replacements:Arr for Hodgson (54), Chris Jones for Schofield (54), Taulava for Cowan (54).
