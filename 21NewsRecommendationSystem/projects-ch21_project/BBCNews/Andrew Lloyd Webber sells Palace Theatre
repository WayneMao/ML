I can think of no better future custodians of Britain's finest Victorian theatre than my friends Nica and Max."Secondly, the proceeds of the sale will be used to repay debt and to strengthen the balance sheet of Really Useful Theatres."This will allow me to plan the future of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane and continue work on refurbishing The London Palladium."The Palladium has just undergone a refurbishment programme, which saw four of the five of its facades restored.The theatre, which originally opened in 1891 as the Royal English Opera House, has hosted some of the most famous West End shows, including Jesus Christ Superstar, Les Miserables and Monty Python's Spamalot.
