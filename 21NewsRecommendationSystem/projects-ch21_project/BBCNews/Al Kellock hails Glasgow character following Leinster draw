Al Kellock hails Glasgow character following Leinster draw
Captain Al Kellock believes Glasgow Warriors' performance in the 34-34 draw at Leinster was one of "outstanding character and heart".Glasgow let a 27-7 half-time lead slip and after the sin-binning of Niko Matawalu in the second half, trailed the Dublin side 34-27.But Glenn Bryce crossed with five minutes remaining and Peter Horne converted to tie the match."It was fantastic to get the draw at the end," Kellock told BBC Scotland.It was Kellock's 150th game as captain of Glasgow, who now lead Ulster by two points at the top of the Pro12."It was a special night, it would've been slightly more special if we had managed to hang on to that 27-7 lead that we had," he explained."It was a great game of rugby to be involved in. To come away with three points is good for us and good for where we are in the league."We had done so well in the first half, played some outstanding rugby. We knew what was coming at us in the second half, we just didn't deal with it well and were pretty poor for a decent spell of that second half."The last 10-15 minutes was outstanding, the character and the heart that was shown was terrific."Leinster are the team that we've looked at. Their composure when they get in an opposition 22 is very good. They don't do anything fancy, they just use up the phases until the opposition run out of defences."Each side took three points from the encounter and reigning champions Leinster, who are fourth, trail last year's beaten finalists Warriors by eight points and are a point off Munster, who face Connacht on Saturday.The eventual top two will have home ties at the semi-final stage."We're certainly in the mix," added Kellock."We showed how good we can be but we also showed what happens if we switch off and what happens when the opposition are playing well."But we'll be there or thereabouts. We've got another four big league games before the semi-final comes."I believe if we play as well as we can then we can get that home semi-final and take it from there."
