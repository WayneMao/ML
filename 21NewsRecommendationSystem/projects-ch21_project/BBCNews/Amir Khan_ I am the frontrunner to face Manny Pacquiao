Amir Khan: I am the frontrunner to face Manny Pacquiao
Amir Khan says he is the favourite to face Manny Pacquiao in the Filipino boxing legend's final fight.Khan had earlier suggested the match was unlikelybut now believes there is a "big chance" of taking on the seven-weight world champion.Alongside Khan, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum has also named Terence Crawford and Tim Bradley as possible contenders for his star's last bout."I am the front-runner," Khan told BBC Sport."Manny Pacquiao makes a good story because we've been training partners and I've been with his coach Freddie Roach."There's a big chance of the fight happening, it's all about making sure my team is on point with the deal and they need to make sure they get the fight that I want."Khan hoped to be Floyd Mayweather Jr's final opponent before the multiple world champion opted to fight Andre Berto instead but Khan believes Pacquiao, 36, is looking for a higher profileend to his career."It would be Manny Pacquiao's last fight and end his career in a big way, not like Floyd Mayweather where, no disrespect to Berto, but I think Floyd finished his career on a low note," he added.As an alternative to Pacquiao, Khan is not ruling out an all-British clash with Kell Brook despite also identifying rematches with Danny Garcia and Lamont Peterson and a bout with Shawn Porter.Brook, 29,defeated Porter over 12 rounds last yearbut Khan insists his fellow Brit still needs to prove himself against the best."My body's taken all the wear and tear where I'm fighting the best fighters in the world and he's not even fighting half of them," said Khan."I want him to prove himself so it's a big fight, we go into the ring 50-50 and it's a massive fight not only for Great Britain but around the world."Khan is currently training in Doha, the site of the 2015 World Amateur Boxing Championships, and says the Middle East could soon host a headline professional bout."The Middle East has never had a big, big fight," he said."They've had a few decent names but no one in their prime, putting on a world title fight, so I think it's going to happen soon."
