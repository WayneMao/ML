Anthony Pilkington: Top six 'minimum target' for Cardiff City
Cardiff City midfielder Anthony Pilkington believes a top-six finish is the minimum requirement for the Championship club this season.The 27-year-old scored the winner in Saturday's3-2 winat Bolton, which lifted the Bluebirds up to sixth place."Cardiff's a big club. Everyone expects us to be right up there, and rightly so," Pilkington told BBC Radio Wales."I don't think you'll find a stronger subs bench in the whole Championship. There is real quality in the squad."Cardiff have now lost just two of their last 11 games, keeping five clean sheets."The minimum has to be play-offs for a club like Cardiff in this league," Pilkington continued."It gives us a big lift now going into the Christmas period."Everyone is together. There is nobody moaning.""Hopefully everyone can stay injury free over the Christmas period."We've got a lot of games coming up so hopefully we can get more points on board going into the Christmas period."Russell Slade's side now face three games in the space of six days, all of which are against sides just below them in the league table.Cardiff host Sheffield Wednesday and Brentford on 12 and 15 December respectively, before an away game against Birmingham City on 18 December.
