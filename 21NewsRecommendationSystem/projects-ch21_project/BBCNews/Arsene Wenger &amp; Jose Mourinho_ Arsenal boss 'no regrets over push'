Media playback is not supported on this deviceArsenal boss Arsene Wenger says he does not regret shoving Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho in a heated touchline spat.The pair clashed after a challenge by Gary Cahill on Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez inChelsea's 2-0 home win."What is to regret after that? I wanted to go from A to B and somebody confronted me without any sign of welcome," Wenger said."B was get to Sanchez to see if he was injured. Was it a push? A little one. You can see when I really try to push."Wenger and Mourinho were separated by fourth official Jon Moss at Stamford Bridge and, as referee Martin Atkinson dealt with the issue at the time, the Football Association will take no further action.Chelsea boss Mourinho said he wanted to "forget" about the incident with the Frenchman, and insisted he had done nothing wrong."It becomes heated because this is a big game, big clubs, big rivals, and important match for both teams. These conditions make a game of emotions,'' he said.Media playback is not supported on this device"I do so many wrong things in football. But not this time because this time I was just in my technical area and it was not my problem. Game over. Story over."The relationship between the two managers has been tempestuous in the past, withMourinho labelling Wenger "a specialist in failure"in February this year.The League Managers' Association declined to comment on the row, saying it was an internal matter for both clubs.Mourinho also said he would never interfere in medical decisions after Thibaut Courtois suffered a head injury following a collision with Chile forward Sanchez and had to be replaced in goal by Petr Cech."The club doctor, or the club medical department take control and the responsibility," added the Portuguese."I just want them to give me a decision and they gave me a decision. For me that's correct."
