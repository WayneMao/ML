Arsenal's Rhys Murphy on trial as Hibs make Jim Goodwin enquiry
Arsenal striker Rhys Murphy will go trial with Hibernian, whose manager, Pat Fenlon, has admitted his interest in St Mirren's Jim Goodwin.Murphy will take part in a closed doors game with Partick Thistle on Monday.Fenlon has contacted St Mirren about midfielder Goodwin but rejected suggestions he has made a move for Middlesbrough's Kevin Thomson.Former Hibs playmaker Thomson joined Boro 18 months ago from Rangers and has since been plagued with injuries."He is a good player and has had a few injury problems, but it has not been on my radar, definitely not," Fenlon told BBC Scotland."I read it in the paper and it alerted me to it. I've got a few friends at Middlesbrough, so maybe we'll make a call and see where it is."The 21-year-old Murphy was a youth player with Wimbledon in 2004 before joining Arsenal later that year.Ryan's a striker with very good movement and a good finisher, a typical Arsenal player, his touch is very good and his movement is first classHe had a loan spell with Brentford in season 2009/10 and has been capped up to under-21 level for England.A move to Rangers did not come to fruition followinga trial with the Ibrox clubin August and now Murphy has returned to Scotland to be assessed by Fenlon."He's coming from a fantastic club and has learned the right way," said Fenlon."He's a striker with very good movement and a good finisher, a typical Arsenal player, his touch is very good and his movement is first class."He's hungry now to prove himself and get playing football matches at a higher level and we'll have a look at him and see how well he does."Fenlon was coy about other signing targets."I am reluctant to talk about individual players at the moment, because players are playing for other clubs and you're trying to be respectful to the manager because I wouldn't like people talking about my players," said the Hibs boss."We are close on a couple of things, but until you are over the line you're reluctant to say too much."However, Irishman Goodwin, who joined the Buddies a year ago from Hamilton Academical and has been offered a new two-year contract by the Paisley club, is in Hibs' sights.Prior to that, the 30-year-old played in England's lower leagues with Stockport County, Scunthorpe, Huddersfield Town and Oldham.His career began with Celtic, where he made only a solitary appearance.
