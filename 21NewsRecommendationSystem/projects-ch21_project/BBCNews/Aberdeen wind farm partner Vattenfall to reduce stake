Aberdeen wind farm partner Vattenfall to reduce stake
New funding is being sought for a wind farm scheme off the coast of Aberdeen, opposed by Donald Trump, after a major investor announced plans to reduce its stake in the project.The £230m European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) scheme consists of 11 wind turbines.US businessman Mr Trump, who has a golf development in Aberdeenshire, opposes wind farms.Vattenfall said it was having to "prioritise its investments".The EOWDC project is a joint venture with engineering firm Technip and the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg).EOWDC partners have now called on the offshore wind sector to back the scheme with new investment.Peter Wesslau, Vattenfall's UK country manager, said: "The EOWDC is a scheme that will benefit the whole offshore wind industry as it will help to drive down the cost of generation and secure industrial benefits for the UK."We therefore believe that the EOWDC deserves wider support through the forging of a strategic industrial alliance."However, like all energy companies across Europe, there are constraints on our capital budgets and so Vattenfall has had to prioritise its investments which means calling on new investors to help realise the more than £230m investment in the EOWDC."Mr Trump is challenging the Scottish government's decision to grant planning permission for the wind farm.He opposes the development because he says it would spoil the view from his Menie estate golf course.The businessman has said his 140-bedroom hotel at Menie will only proceed if plans for the wind farm do not go ahead.
