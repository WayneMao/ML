Angus farm distillery launches home-grown potato vodka
An Angus farm and distillery which produces its spirits from scratch has launched its first potato vodka.The Arbikie Distillery, housed in a farm overlooking Lunan Bay, is the first in the country to produce both white and brown spirits entirely from ingredients grown on-site.The family firm has farmed at Arbikie for four generations, and is now targeting the premium spirits market.The distillery aims to produce whisky and gin from next year.Arbikie Distillery is part of the 2000-acre Arbikie Highland Estate, between Montrose and Arbroath, which has been run by the Stirling family for four generations.Brothers John, Iain and David Stirling hope to crack the premium and luxury alcohol retail market across the UK before expanding abroad.The distillery, based in an old barn at the farm, can produce 560 litres of pure alcohol daily.It uses copper pot stills in the style of whisky distilling in the production of all its spirits, which the Stirling brothers said added depth and quality to the whisky.The spirits are fermented, distilled, bottled, labelled and matured on-site, as well as being crafted entirely from locally-grown ingredients.The gluten-free potato vodka is created using Scottish water and a blend of Maris Piper, King Edwards and Cultra potatoes all grown locally.Iain Stirling, Arbikie commercial director, said Scotland has a "world class drinks industry".He said: "We saw a real opportunity to utilise Scotland's acclaimed natural assets from its clear waters, rich crops and temperamental climate, alongside its renowned whisky heritage, to produce a new generation of exceptional quality spirits."As a family business, it is wonderful to have the freedom to be innovative."
