Ariel Sharon's mark on history
Ariel Sharon's life was intimately entwined with the life of the country he loved from the moment of its birth.He fought in its war of independence in 1948 and from that point until he slipped into a coma in 2006 it seemed there was hardly a moment of national drama in which he did not play a role.He was always a controversial figure in Israeli politics - certainly not universally loved - but in mourning his passing, Israelis are marking the loss of one of the few public figures left whose career stretched back to the earliest days of their state.Ariel Sharon's roots were in the world of Zionist pioneering zeal - he was born between the two world wars in Palestine when it was under British control - to a Jewish couple who had fled to the Holy Land from Belarus.His reputation as an uncompromising and unapologetic defender of his country's interests dates back to his military career.He was still a teenager when he fought in the war of 1948 and in his autobiography, fittingly called Warrior, he described intense fighting against soldiers from the Jordanian Arab Legion for control of a crucial police fort on the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.He and his men lay in fields ignited by gunfire in the burning heat with water and ammunition running low.He remained a soldier for many years afterwards, fighting with distinction in Israel's battles with its Arab enemies in the wars of 1967 and 1973.He helped set up Unit 101 - a commando detachment whose job was to conduct reprisal operations across the border in Arab territories to retaliate for attacks against Israel.Such was his reputation as a military commander that some accounts of his army career say he was nicknamed the Lion of God after a particularly daring tactical parachute operation against Egypt in 1967 in the Sinai desert.But already there was a dark undertone. Allegations emerged that Egyptian prisoners had been shot and there were questions at home about whether the operation had been a military necessity.Fifteen years later, it was another dark episode that brought Ariel Sharon international attention.He was minister of defence when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982. The strategic goal was to bring stability to the country's northern border by crushing Yasser Arafat's PLO, which was then holed up in southern Lebanon and Beirut.But the war was deeply controversial at home as well as in the wider world.And there was worse too.Fighters from a Christian militia group which was co-operating closely with the Israelis carried out extensive massacres in Palestinian refugee camps in Sabra and Shatilla.It is likely the names of those camps will be associated with Mr Sharon's own name as long as the history of that conflict is remembered.Eventually an Israeli inquiry held that Ariel Sharon was "indirectly responsible" for the killing.The war cost many lives - Israeli as well as Palestinian and Lebanese - and it casts a long shadow over his historical legacy.Within Israel Mr Sharon was not finished though.Long a supporter of the settlers who moved on to the lands Israel captured in the war of 1967 in defiance of international opinion, he saw himself as a natural leader of the Israeli right.In a volatile place, he could be a provocative figure.In the year 2000, flanked by hundreds of Israeli riot police, he staged a visit to the area of the Old City in Jerusalem which contains sites sacred both to Jews and Muslims - the Temple Mount or Harem al-Sharif.Even though the area is in the part of East Jerusalem captured by Israel in the war of 1967, Jewish rights to pray there are limited - and it is a microcosm of the tensions that fuel the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.Intense rioting followed his visit there and many people trace the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada to that moment.Ariel Sharon was characteristically unrepentant.He became prime minister in 2001, promising to bring peace and security to his country but it was a turbulent period in Israeli politics and he eventually left the governing Likud party to found his own Kadima movement while still in office.Peace remained elusive then as it is elusive now.It was on his watch as prime minister that construction of a barrier began with the intention of preventing suicide attacks on Israel from the Palestinian territories.His supporters would argue that it worked. Its detractors would say it entrenched an already deep sense of separateness.He did not shy away from bold political moves though. The man who had supported Israeli settlers ordered their removal from Gaza when he decided to withdraw from the Palestinian enclave beside the Mediterranean in 2005.It was precisely his reputation as a hardliner that allowed him to sell to his supporters a decision with which many felt instinctively uncomfortable.Not long afterwards, he slipped into the coma from which he was never to emerge and we will never know how he would have followed up that decision or where it might have led.Ariel Sharon died hated by Israel's enemies but there are plenty of Israelis who would argue that the depth of that hatred was a measure of the success with which he always defended the country he served.
