Andrew Gale: Michael Vaughan says ECB's ruling was 'disgrace'
Former Yorkshire batsman Michael Vaughan says the England and Wales Cricket Board's decision to bar Andrew Gale from lifting the Championship trophy was "petty" and "a disgrace".Yorkshire clinched their first County title for 13 years withvictory over Nottinghamshire on Friday.Skipper Gale did not lift the trophy as the ECB felt it was not appropriate while he awaits a disciplinary hearing."I thought it was a disgrace," Vaughan said. "It was petty from the ECB."Gale, 30, wasbanned for the final two Championship gamesfollowing an altercation with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince on the third evening of his side's innings and 18-run win at Old Trafford earlier this month.He was reported by the umpires for "using language or gesture that is obscene or of a serious insulting nature" and an ECB statement at the time said: "The Cricket Discipline Commission will also consider whether any further action needs to be taken in relation to Mr Gale."Media playback is not supported on this deviceA further ECB statement on Friday added that in the circumstances "it was not felt appropriate for Mr Gale to be involved in today's LV=CC Division One trophy presentation at Trent Bridge".Gale was absent from the field as Yorkshire crushed Nottinghamshire by an innings and 152 runs and then had to watch on as stand-in skipper Joe Root received the trophy at the formal presentation."I think the club should have had the opportunity to say who they wanted to lift that trophy," former England captain Vaughan added on BBC Radio 5 live."I guarantee that everybody wanted Andrew Gale to get on the podium and lift that trophy."Yorkshire's final match of the summer against Somerset begins at Headingley on 23 September.
