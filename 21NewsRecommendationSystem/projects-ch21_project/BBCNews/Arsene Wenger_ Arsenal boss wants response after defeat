I knew it could be a tricky game. If you can't win the game, make sure you don't lose it."Wenger, whose side finished third last season and won the FA Cup, has been under pressure to add players to his squad, with keeper Petr Cech - a  Â£10m signing from Chelsea - the only summer arrival at the Emirates.Real Madrid striker Karim Benzemais a reported target for Arsenal,but Wenger said new additions would not have aided a performance where his side managed just six shots on target."I would like to think that we are responsible for buying the players, not the media," the Frenchman said."When you're a pro footballer, you have to face your responsibilities and not always look at something else."Today we have to look at ourselves and think we were not good enough and not to think that these kinds of things [signings] are solutions for us."
