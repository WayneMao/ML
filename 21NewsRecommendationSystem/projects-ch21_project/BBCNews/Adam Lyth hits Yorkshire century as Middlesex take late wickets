Adam Lyth hits Yorkshire century as Middlesex take late wickets
Opener Adam Lyth's century was the highlight on a mixed day for Yorkshire, who ended day one with 211-6 after Middlesex's bowlers rallied late on.Lyth lost partner Adam Lees for 28 when he was caught behind by John Simpson from Toby Rowland-Jones's delivery.England seamer Steven Finn bowled Kane Williamson, and struck again to remove Andrew Gale, caught by Chris Rogers.Jonny Bairstow and Jack Leaning both departed before Lyth eventually succumbed to Tom Helm on 117.Not even a soggy start seemed to impact on the play at Scarborough's North Marine Ground, although bad light did bring the teams off on 76 overs.For Middlesex, Roland-Jones and Finn both claimed two wickets, as did Helm who bowled Bairstow for just five runs from 42 balls and then had Lyth caught by Dawid Malan after a dogged innings.Leaning made just two runs for Yorkshire, while Gale made 30 and Williamson notched 14.It was Whitby-born Lyth's fourth ton of the season - and his first at his home ground - and he also passed 1,000 Division One runs in 2014.Tim Bresnan (0) will resume on day two with Adil Rashid (3), who was put down by Simpson late on.BBC Radio Leeds commentator Dave Callaghan:"Adam Lyth is having a great season for Yorkshire. A century for the Tykes against Middlesex - and when he had reached 113 he became the first to 1,000 runs in Division One this season."Thank goodness for his efforts as others in the Yorkshire line up perished cheaply. Lyth eventually went for 117 as Middlesex enjoyed  a golden last hour prompting a mini Yorkshire collapse."BBC Radio London 94.9FM commentator Kevin Hand:"Middlesex fought back with the ball in the evening session after a defiant response from the hosts to being put in.The visitors will perhaps reflect that they could have forced the Yorkshire opening pair to play more earlier in the day and Adam Lyrh made the most of his patient start and capitalised on being dropped on 75 by Eoin Morgan off Toby Roland-Jones."There is plenty in the pitch, which has more than a greenish top, and Middlesex must be wary of allowing the Yorkshire lower order adding too many more."
