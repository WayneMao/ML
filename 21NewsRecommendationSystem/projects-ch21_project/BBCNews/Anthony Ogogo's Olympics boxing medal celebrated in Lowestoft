Anthony Ogogo's Olympics boxing medal celebrated in Lowestoft
"I almost feel the punches and it's so tense - your body tightens up, but he's the one with the courage to get in the ring," said Toni Ogogo.The 25-year-old sister of Lowestoft boxer Anthony Ogogo has been avidly following his journey to winning a bronze medal at the London 2012 Olympics.The 23-year-old middleweight lost 16-9 on points to Esquiva Falcao of Brazil in the semi-finals at the ExCel Arena in London.Toni was at the arena to watch her younger brother."It's intense with the whole crowd behind him and there are so many emotions that you go through," she said."It's disappointing but I think the whole of Lowestoft will be proud that a medal has come back, whatever colour it is."Ogogo's mother Teresa had a brain aneurysm on 19 June and, after treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, she was transferred to the James Paget Hospital at Gorlestone, near Lowestoft.Toni said: "She's getting there and recovering and she's been able to watch on television."Lowestoft is already arranging a homecoming celebration for Anthony and it will be well-deserved with the upset with Mum that he's gone through."A crowd watched the fight on television at the Nirvana Fitness gym in Lowestoft, where Ogogo's Triple A Boxing Club trains.Ogogo's uncle Mark Sharman was there and said: "He will not be satisfied with his performance, but most of all he was fighting for his mum."He probably doesn't think it himself, but what's happened in the past couple of months has got to affect something."Gym owner Chris Broadley said: "It's a terrific achievement and it'll be interesting to see if Anthony stays amateur."I think with the sponsorship they're getting from the lottery fund and from this result he probably could afford to stay amateur."Whatever he does, he will do well and it's been great for the club."Mayor of Lowestoft Nick Webb said: "Anthony's done superbly well just to get to the Olympics after his injuries, let along win the bronze."We will be planning a civic celebration, but I can't confirm anything yet as it's going to be dependent on what Anthony and his family want."He's done the whole town proud."
