Alastair Cook admits England 'have not been good enough'
England one-day captain Alastair Cook admits that his side have "not been good enough" to compete with India as they lose the second of the five-match one-day seriesby eight wickets in Delhito trail 2-0.Having won the toss and batted, England found themselves 0-2 after Cook and fellow opener Craig Kieswetter were dismissed inside the first two overs. England managed to post 237 but despite starts no batsmen made a fifty.In contrast, Virat Kohli (112) and Gautam Gambhir (84) reacted to the early loss of India's openers by putting together an unbeaten stand of 209.England must now avoid defeat in the third one-dayer in Mohali on Thursday to keep the series alive.
