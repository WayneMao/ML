A police force whose chief quit after being found guilty of misconduct is a step closer to having a permanent boss.Avon and Somerset Police has been without a substantive chief constable since Nick Gargan was suspended pending an investigation in May 2014.He was later found guilty of eight counts of misconduct andquit the role in October.Andy Marsh has been named by the Police and Crime Commissioner as the preferred candidate for his permanent successor.The appointment is subject to confirmation by an Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Panel hearing scheduled for 14 December.Andy Marsh,currently the head  of Hampshire Constabulary, said he was "thrilled" to be selected to re-join the force he began his career with in 1987."Avon and Somerset is a good police force. I will work tirelessly with officers, staff and volunteers of the constabulary to deliver excellent policing services to the communities within which my family and I live," he said.Commissioner Sue Mountstevens thanked acting chief officer Gareth Morgan, who has led the force for the last three months since the retirement of another acting chief constable.She said: "It's no secret that there are tough times ahead for policing with continuing budget pressures combined with a changing landscape and new demands."I'm confident that Andy is the person to lead Avon and Somerset and work with me to build safer, stronger communities and ensure the people of Avon and Somerset have the very best police service."
