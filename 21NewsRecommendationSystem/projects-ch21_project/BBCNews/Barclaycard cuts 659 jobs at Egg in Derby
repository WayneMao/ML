Barclaycard has announced it is closing its Egg credit card service centre in Derby, meaning the loss of more than 650 jobs in the city.Egg's 1.15 million UK credit card accounts were acquired by Barclaycard in April.As a result, accounts will be serviced from the firm's centres across the UK and abroad, and 659 posts will go from Derby's Pride Park site.Barclaycard's Paula Gowland said some staff would be offered redeployment."By the end of the year, we will cease operations in Derby," said Ms Rowland, Barclaycard's director of operations."We have also announced our absolute intention to provide colleagues impacted by that decision here in Derby with an extensive package of support to achieve the desired outcome for them."We are very conscious that it is disappointing news but there is an overwhelming sense of relief we have shared our plans. It has ended a long period of uncertainty."Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said the news was a "real body blow for the city"."Derby's been struck by a destructive, economic tornado over the past two weeks with the announcement at Bombardier last week and now this," he said.Operations will cease in November. Egg was bought by US bank Citigroup from Prudential in January 2007.Citigroup UK still has about 650 employees at the Pride Park offices.
