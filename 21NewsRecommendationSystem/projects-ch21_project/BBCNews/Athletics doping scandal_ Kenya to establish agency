Athletics doping scandal: Kenya to establish agency
Kenya's government has approved the immediate establishment of an anti-doping agency.It comes amid turmoil in athletics, with Russia accused of "state-sponsored doping" in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).In it, the report's co-author, Dick Pound, also alleged that Kenya has a "real problem with doping".Kenya's new agency will carry out testing and ensure compliance with doping rules, a statement said.There are 15 Kenyans currently banned for doping by the IAAF, including three-time Boston Marathon winner Rita Jeptoo.The head of Kenya's Olympic committee, Kipchoge Keino, has accused his government of complacency."I have tried to reach government officials to agree on how to act but I don't get appointments," he said.Wada's report accuses Russian athletes of widespread doping, alleging the country had "sabotaged" the 2012 Olympics in London.But Mr Pound also said that the allegations were "just the tip of the iceberg".Russia has called the allegations groundless.It is still waiting to learnif it will be suspended from the 2016 Olympics.
