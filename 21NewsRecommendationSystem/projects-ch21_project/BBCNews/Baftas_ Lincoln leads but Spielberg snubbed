US civil war drama, Lincoln has led this year's Baftas with 10 nominations including best film and best actor for Daniel Day-Lewis.Day-Lewis's co-stars Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field have been shortlisted for best supporting actor and actress.However, the film's award-winning director Steven Spielberg missed out in the best director category.Musical adaptation Les Miserables and Ang Lee's Life of Pi have both received nine nominations.Speaking to the BBC's Lizo Mzimba at the announcement, film critic Mark Kermode said: "As far as Lincoln was concerned, all the attention was on Daniel Day-Lewis."Whatever anybody thinks about the film - and the critics have been somewhat divided, everybody thought his performance was captivating and completely believable."Lincoln- 10Les Miserables- 9Life Of Pi- 9Skyfall(pictured) - 8Argo- 7Anna Karenina- 6Read the full list of nomineesFollowing closely behind the leaders pack was Bond film Skyfall with eight nominations, including best British film and best supporting actor and actress for Javier Bardem and Judi Dench.It will battle it out with four other titles to be named outstanding British film at the awards ceremony on 10 February.They were The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Anna Karenina, Les Miserables, and Seven Psychopaths.The nominations were announced by Alice Eve and Jeremy Irvine at the The British Academy of Film and Television Arts headquarters in London on Wednesday.Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman have been recognised in the lead actor and supporting actress categories in Tom Hooper's big-screen adaptation of Les Miserables.Political thriller Argo has received seven nominations with Ben Affleck in the running for best director and best actor.Other American movies to feature in the shortlist for this year's Bafta awards were Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master which received four nominations, and Zero Dark Thirty with five nominations, including best director for Kathryn Bigelow.Bigelow - who became the first woman to win the Oscar for directing with 2008's The Hurt Locker - said she was "immensely grateful" for her latest accolade."When you're making a film you have no idea how it will be received, and I can assure you it is overwhelming to receive news like this," she added.Silver Linings Playbook garnered nods for Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in the best actress and best actor categories. The romantic comedy-drama has also been nominated for best adapted screenplay.Dame Helen Mirren has been nominated for best actress for her role as Alfred Hitchcock's wife in Hitchcock."This was a wonderful role," said Mirren, adding: "Alma Reville was more than Hitchcock's wife, in many ways she was his muse, his assistant, his editor and more, and I am proud to have had the opportunity to portray her."There were some notable exclusions in this year's shortlist.While Les Miserables was the only British film to feature in both the best film and best British film categories, its Oscar-winning director, Tom Hooper, missed out on a director's nod while another British Oscar-winner, Sam Mendes, was also left out of the same category for Skyfall.Eric Fellner of Working Title Films, which produced Les Miserables, said Hooper may be upset he was left off the roll for best director "on a personal level"."But on a professional level he'll realise he's made a film that's got nine nominations and as far as we're concerned, the director is the heart and centre of all the films that we make and it's just not possible to get nine nominations without great directorial input."He added: "The great news is that yesterday, Tom Hooper got a Directors Guild of America (DGA) nomination, which is really prestigious."James Bond star Daniel Craig, who was nominated for his role as the suave spy in the film Casino Royale, also missed out in the acting category.Though the film is in the running for best British film, it means the Bond series is still looking for its first ever nomination for best film.Anna Karenina, based on the original Tolstoy novel and directed by Joe Wright, received a total of six nominations, including best British film. It is also in the running for best original music, and best cinematography.There were just three technical nominations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.Searching for Sugar Man, the true story of the 1970s rocker Rodriguez is up against The Imposter, about the 1997 case of the French confidence man Frederic Bourdin for best documentary.Also in the category were McCullin, West of Memphis and Marley.Director of The Imposter, Bart Layton, who was nominated for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer, said he did a "double take" when the nominations were announced."I think this is one of the strongest years for documentaries that I can remember across the board, so the fact that we made it into that final group [is amazing]."It is a documentary, but it should be up there competing with non-documentaries.  The fact it's been acknowledged in that context is testament to that being successful," he said.Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or-winner, Amour, about an octogenarian couple coping with illness received four nominations, with Emmanuelle Riva, 85, announced as in the running for best actress and Haneke up for best director.Completing the line up for best director was Quentin Tarantino for Django Unchained, which received a total of five nominations, including best supporting actor for Christoph Waltz.The nominees for this year's Bafta rising star award were announced on Monday with four out of the five contenders female.Juno Temple, Andrea Riseborough, Elizabeth Olsen, Alicia Vikander and Life of Pi actor Suraj Sharma have all been tipped as the future stars of cinema.Previous winners include James McAvoy, Kristen Stewart and Tom Hardy.It is the only accolade at the annual awards ceremony to be voted for by the public.The winners of the 2013 Bafta film awards will be announced at a ceremony which takes place for the seventh year running at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London, hosted by Stephen Fry.
