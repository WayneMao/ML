Aurigny not to charge for baggage
Guernsey States-owned airline Aurigny says it has no plans to charge passengers for baggage.The airline, which lost £1.6m in 2009 and had lost £1.4m by November 2010, said this was despite the fact it could be a revenue earner.Malcolm Coupar, commercial director, said in reality the additional costs could drive away regular passengers.He said the charge was a practice that was known to be unpopular with travellers.Mr Coupar said: "Excess baggage, or in fact baggage full stop, is one of the contentious issues that people have with the low cost carriers."It's undoubtedly a revenue opportunity, but it could alienate our regular customers and I don't think the revenues we'd collect from baggage charges would replace that revenue."
