Baby murder accused James Hunt 'jealous of natural father'
A man accused of killing a 10-month-old baby girl was jealous of her natural father, a jury at Exeter Crown Court has been told.Kimberly Barrett died in hospital four days after she was violently shaken or slammed down by James Hunt, 30, the prosecution alleges.Mr Hunt, of Pellinore Road in Exeter, denies murder.Kimberly's mother, Hayley Bradshaw, left the baby in his care to visit a neighbour on Christmas night in 2011.The jury was told Mr Hunt was angry and upset at not being able to spend Christmas Day with his own two young children and attacked the baby because he could not stop her crying.Miss Bradshaw, 26, said when she was at her neighbour's house, she was disturbed by Mr Hunt who told her to come home because Kimberley was "kicking off"."James came to Keith's flat and asked how much longer I would be and said Kimberly was really kicking off," she said."I went back soon afterwards. He said he had managed to settle her with a bottle and said not to disturb her."He told me she had gone floppy and fallen back in the cot, but I did not think anything of it at the time."She said Kimberly woke shortly after midnight vomiting so she took her into her bed.The jury was told the baby's body became slack as she fell unconscious at about 18:00 on Boxing Day."She was so floppy I could not hold her over my shoulder," Miss Bradshaw said."She could not hold her head up and I cradled in my arms."Miss Bradshaw told the jury her relationship with Mr Hunt was poor and he refused to help with child care.She said when she rang Mr Hunt from the hospital to get details of Kimberly's weight and height from the health visitor's diary, he became jealous she was with the natural father, who had been called in."Kimberly was transferred to the Bristol Children's Hospital," Miss Bradshaw said."He rang me on the way and was angry because he could not get into the home. He did not ask about Kimberly."The trial continues.
