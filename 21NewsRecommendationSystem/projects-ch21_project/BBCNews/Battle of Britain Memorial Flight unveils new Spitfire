Battle of Britain Memorial Flight unveils new Spitfire
A Spitfire has flown at a Lincolnshire airbase after an 11-year restoration.Spitfire TE311 last took to the air in 1954 but has been rebuilt by technicians from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF).The BBMF, based at RAF Coningsby, already has six spitfires but there are only few dozen other airworthy examples in the world.Sqn Ldr Duncan Mason said the new machine was "a dream" to fly.TE311 is a Mk XVI with "clipped" wingtips, which alter the classic Spitfire silhouette.It was built in 1945 and was mainly used for training.The aircraft spent several years on display at RAF Tangmere and was then used as a static exhibit at many air shows, as part of the RAF Exhibition Flight.Sqn Ldr Mason said: "It was phenomenal, the aircraft is a dream to fly, so it was a very successful flight."It's magical - you really have to keep pinching yourself, when you look out and see the wings and you realise you are sat in a Spitfire."TE311 is painted as Spitfire XVI TB675 '4D-V', the aircraft of Squadron Leader Tony Reeves DFC, who was the commanding officer of No 74 Squadron in 1945.The event was attended by members of the Lincolnshire's Lancaster Association who contributed funds towards the project.
