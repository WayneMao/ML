Accounts Commission finds improvements at Argyll and Bute Council
A council which was strongly criticised by the public spending watchdog over failures in governance has made solid improvements, a new report has found.In 2013, the Accounts Commission said political instability at Argyll and Bute Council had led to a lack of collective strategic leadership.Its new report found better decision-making, governance and scrutiny.The council said it welcomed the findings but remained "committed to further improvements".Accounts Commission chairman Douglas Sinclair said: "Argyll and Bute has made good progress but has more to do in key areas such as being more open and transparent, how it engages with the public, and developing a longer term financial strategy."There are now good foundations on which it can build."The latest Accounts Commission report states the council - which covers a large and mostly sparsely populated area, including several large islands - should look at changing the way it delivers services to help save money.The commission also said in its report that the council had, so far, looked mostly at cutting services rather than finding ways to do things differently.It said that this approach was "not sustainable".The report also highlighted long-standing personal and political differences between a small number of councillors, senior officers and the Argyll and Bute constituency MSP, Mike Russell.The commission said its "firm view" was that the interests of the public were best served by a shared commitment by all parties to maintaining constructive relationships and high standards of conduct.Argyll and Bute Council leader Dick Walsh said: "We are a very different council from the one Audit Scotland first visited in 2013."This level of progress is highlighted by the fact that there will be no follow-up visit to Argyll and Bute Council.''We have made changes where needed. We have solid structures in place as well as support and positive attitudes which mean we are managing the business of the council more effectively."Mr Walsh said that despite the positive report, the council would not be complacent.He added: ''Of course, as is the purpose of any audit, it highlights areas for further improvement and we have already taken steps to embrace these recommendations, from putting plans in place to develop a greater level of innovation in the way we work to identifying proposals for greater engagement with our communities.''There are four elements to the planning our future initiative - growing our economy, innovation, investing for income and service choices."We are receiving a wide range of suggestions from our communities, ones which we will use to inform the budget decisions we take at our meeting in February."Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said: "I have met with the senior figures in the council recently to see if I could help them with the mess they are in and I will go on  attempting to secure a better deal for all those I represent."Audit Scotland has rightly criticised the present round of cuts and pointed to the failure of the council to plan ahead and find ways to deliver services more effectively."That will cause huge problems for the poorest and most disadvantaged across this very big and very rural constituency."
