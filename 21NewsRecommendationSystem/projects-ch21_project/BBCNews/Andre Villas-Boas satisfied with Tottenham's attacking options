I went to see him in Brazil when I was not doing anything and he is obviously a good player but not on our prospects at the moment."Villas-Boas is expecting Luka Modric to leave Spurs for Real Madridbefore the end of the transfer window and is frustrated at the time taking to conclude the deal."It has been dragging on for some time, we have been very patient and the chairman has to be very astute," said Villas-Boas."We hope to conclude in the next few days but I said the same thing last week."We have people we're looking at and we have to be able to react straight away."Villas-Boas also admitted Michael Dawson,  would have limited first-team chances if he remained at Tottenham."If you end up with five central defenders then it's more competition and there will be less opportunities, that's why we allowed him to speak to QPR," added Villas-Boas.
