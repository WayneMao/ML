Australia seal Test win over Sri Lanka in Galle
A battling century from Mahela Jayawardene was not enough to save hosts Sri Lanka from a heavy defeat in the first Test against Australia.Jayawardene (105) and Angelo Mathews (95) combined in a sixth-wicket stand of 142 to frustrate the tourists.But when Jayawardene was removed by Ryan Harris (5-62), the Australians raced to a 125-run victory.The result means Australia's Ricky Ponting becomes the first player to play on the winning side in 100 Tests.Afterwards, it was announced that Ponting will miss the second Test to attend the birth of his second child, and Twenty20 specialist David Warner, who has played only nine first-class games, has been called up as a replacement.Shaun Marsh, currently the reserve batsman in the squad who is also uncapped at Test level, is also in contention to replace Ponting in the XI.Starting day five on 120, chasing an unlikely 379 for victory, Sri Lanka batted just three and a half overs before rain stopped play.When the match resumed, Jayawardene and Mathews safely guided their side through the morning session.But Harris and Mitchell Johnson combined well to remove Surah Randiv (0) and Rangana Herath (12) cheaply, following Jayawardene's dismissal.Mathews' resistance eventually gave out when he was bowled by Shane Watson as he swiped across the line.Suranga Lakmal (5) was the last man to go when he was caught by Johnson off the bowling of Nathan Lyon.
