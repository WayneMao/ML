Andy Murray: Jonas Bjorkman set for bigger role through summer
Andy Murray's new coach Jonas Bjorkman will spend the whole of the summer with the British number one.The Swede will be with Murray's team through Wimbledon and until at least the end of the US Open in September as main coach Amelie Mauresmo prepares to have herfirst child in August.Former world number four Bjorkman, 43,links up with Murray,27, for the first time at this week's BMW Open in Munich.The arrangement was initially atwo-week trial."After Wimbledon, providing everything is good, I'm going to spend the whole of the hard-court stretch through to the end of the US Open with Jonas,"said Murray."Then I'll see what happens with Amelie because I don't think she knows what her priorities are going to be and how she wants to deal with things so we'll just see for a few months."French Fed Cup captain Mauresmo has led Murray's coaching team since her appointment last June and works with the Scot for 25 weeks a year.Under previous coach Ivan Lendl, Murray won his first Grand Slam at the 2012 US Open, Olympic gold and the 2013 Wimbledon title.
