Alastair Cook calls on England batsmen to deliver in India
England captain Alastair Cook urged his batsmen to learn from India's example as the tourists look to bounce back from 2-0 down in their one-day series.Virat Kohli (112) and Gautam Gambhir (84) guided India to an eight-wicket win after England were bowled out for 237 with no batsman reaching fifty."They did everything which we didn't do with our batting," Cook told BBC Sport."We had lots of 30s and 40s but that doesn't win the game. Virat and Gautam showed what a partnership can do."England,beaten by 126 runs in Friday's opener, recovered from 0-2 to reach 121-3, but they lost wickets in clusters and were bowled out with 10 balls of their 50 overs still remaining.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIndia cantered to their target with 13.2 overs to spare to leave England needing to avoid defeat on Thursday in Mohali to keep the five-match series alive."We had excellent preparation, we got everything out of the practice games but we just haven't delivered that in the middle here," added Cook."That's obviously a bit of a mental thing, but credit to India because they have outplayed us twice."It's very hard when you do get behind the eight-ball to drag it back but it's only the players who can turn it around."England have won only four of their last 23 completed ODIs against India in IndiaFor India, two resounding wins are helping bury the demons of their miserable winless summer in England."I'm really happy we are on the winning side," said captain Mahendra Dhoni. "The series in England was not a good one, but we showed character."We didn't get frustrated, we remained social on the field and didn't lose our temper."It's good to be on the winning side now but we take it one win at a time. We have to do the right things and, whatever the result, it is about improving ourselves as cricketers."Man-of-the-match Kohli revelled in the glory of scoring his seventh one-day international century on his home ground."Being at my home ground is always a special feeling," he said. "I was really keen to perform and luckily I pulled it off."For the latest updates and reaction to this story readSportsday Live. Have your say on Twitter via the hashtag #bbcsportsday.
