Ann Widdecombe leaves Strictly Come Dancing
Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe has failed to reach the semi-finals of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing show after she was voted off by the public.Widdecombe, 63, who lasted 10 weeks despite her lack of dancing ability, said it had been a "magnificent" and "life-enhancing" experience.Judge Bruno Tonioli had described her as like "a Dalek in drag" on Saturday.Scott Maslen, Pamela Stephenson, Kara Tointon, Gavin Henson and Matt Baker will appear in next week's semi-finals.After Widdecombe's routine to musical tune Hello, Dolly! on Saturday, Tonioli said it was "more like hello trolley" after he said her partner Anton du Beke had pushed her around the dance floor.Fellow judge Alesha Dixon, meanwhile, said: "I think the honeymoon is over.""It's a bit disappointing," said Widdecombe after she and Du Beke were booted off the show."We were both hoping to get into the semi-finals but the reality was, the way the cookie was crumbling, there were four very good dancers left."The chance of getting further than the semi-finals was remote."Widdecombe came below EastEnders actor Maslen, who was second from bottom after the public vote.Widdecombe, who will dance on the Strictly Come Dancing tour - which starts next month - said she could not have wished for "a better start to retirement".Comedienne and psychologist Pamela Stephenson was watched by husband Billy Connolly in the studio on Saturday night as she received, on her 61st birthday, the first perfect score of 40 this series.She danced a waltz with partner James Jordan to the song Unchained Melody.Two celebrities will be evicted next weekend.
