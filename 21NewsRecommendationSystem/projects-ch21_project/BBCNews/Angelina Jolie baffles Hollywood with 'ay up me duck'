Angelina Jolie baffles Hollywood with 'ay up me duck'
Actress Angelina Jolie left some audience members baffled when she greeted Derby actor Jack O'Connell with "ay up me duck" at an awards ceremony.She spoke in a Derby accent and introduced him with the East Midlands phrase as she presented him with an award at the Hollywood Film Awards.Some television viewers tweeted in delight while others did not understand why she was talking about a duck.O'Connell has the lead role in Jolie's upcoming film Unbroken.She produced and directed the war drama, a chronicle of the life of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who was taken prisoner by Japanese forces during World War Two.Speaking at the awards ceremony in Los Angeles, Angelina Jolie said: "It is my privilege to present the New Hollywood award to the least Hollywood artist I know, straight from Derby, ay up me duck, Jack O'Connell."The audience then laughed when O'Connell greeted them by saying: "Ay up me ducks.""Ay up" is a greeting typically used in the North of England and the Midlands instead of hello."Me" means "my", while "duck" is an affectionate term for another person.It originates from the Saxon word ducas,according to historian Steve Birks, and has nothing to do with the bird of the same name.Prince Harry delighted people in Nottingham last year when he said "ay up me duck" on a visit to the Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies.
