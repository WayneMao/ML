Bad weather and flood warnings as UK hit by strong winds
Gale force winds are battering England and Wales while heavy rain threatens flooding.The Met Office hasissued severe weather warningsfor wind in south-west England, the Midlands and the South East, and for wind and rain in Wales.Floodwarnings and alertsare in place for Wales and southern England as the weather system moves north-east.An18-year-olddied in Sussex after suffering head injuries when his scooter crashed in strong winds.The rider was taken to Hurstwood Park Neurological Centre following the crash in Brighton Road, Lancing, at about 04:25 BST on Friday.Winds have hit 40-50mph inland, while the south Wales coast, the Bristol Channel and the south coast have seen gusts of up to 60mph causing disruption in some areas.One gust of 82mph was recorded at the Needles on the western tip of the Isle of Wight, BBC weather said.The storm has also driven bands of heavy rain across parts of Wales and southwest England, with many areas receiving well in excess of 50mm of rain since Thursday.And some areas have been at risk from high waves as the wind funnels through the Bristol Channel.BBC weather forecaster Laura Gilchrist said: "This weather would not be unusual in October or November, but as it's coming in June the trees are more in leaf and people are carrying out more outdoor activities than then, so there's more risk of disruption than at other times of the year."And Met Office spokesman Charlie Powell warned: "It is possible there could be up to three inches of rain in hilly and mountainous areas of Wales, with lower but still substantial rainfall in more low-lying areas."The adverse weather has led to difficulties all over England and Wales, with the following disruption:There is brighter news for much of England over the weekend, as the weather is set to improve for Saturday - feeling warmer with some sunny spells.However, the Environment Agency has asked people to remain alert for possible localised flooding, particularly in Wales.The Met Office confirmed that while conditions will ease a little by Saturday morning, some areas - especially northern England and mid and north-west Wales - will continue to see rainfall.And even after the rain has ceased, people are advised to take care in potentially hazardous driving conditions, and to listen to traffic reports for advice on disruption.The positioning of the jet stream [a fast-flowing air current in the upper atmosphere] is to blame for such wintry weather in June, added BBC weather forecaster Ms Gilchrist."It should be further north. It's taken a little bit of a dip south, which is allowing weather systems to develop across the UK, but it has the potential to move back again," she said.
