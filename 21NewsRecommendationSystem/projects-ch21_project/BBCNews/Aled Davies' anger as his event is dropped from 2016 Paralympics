It may also include athletes with severe problems when walking, such as impairments in one leg from polio."People are striving to push the world record up to able bodied standard."Davies won gold in theF42 discusandF42 shot putat last week's IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon.The 22-year-old also set a new stadium record in winning the shot at last weekend's Anniversary Games in London.He will be competing at the Welsh Athletics International fixture on Wednesday but Davies said the evening at Cardiff's Leckwith Stadium will be one of "mixed emotions.""I was really looking forward to the Welsh international," Davies told BBC Wales Sport."It was going to be my last competition of the season and then I can think about going into winter training and coming out next year and being even better."At the moment I'm kind of not looking forward to competing now because it could be the last time that I compete in the discus."
