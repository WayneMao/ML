Bath park-and-ride sites set for Sunday service
A regular Sunday bus service is to be introduced at three park and ride sites across Bath.The Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down sites are opened on Sundays in the run up to Christmas but this is the first time the First Group service will operate throughout the year.Simon Ford, from First, said they were responding to customer demand and saw it as a potential area for growth.The new service is set to begin next Sunday.There will also be a more frequent service for students from the city's two universities, Bath University and Bath Spa University.The newly named Service 15, which replaces SPA1 for Bath Spa University, will also have a Sunday service throughout the year, with the aim of linking in better with lecture times.Service 18 for Bath University has also been improved with a more frequent service and a new livery for buses.
