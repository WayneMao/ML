Andy Warhol's Double Elvis artwork could sell for $50m
An Andy Warhol painting of singer Elvis Presley could fetch up to $50m (£31.7m) when sold in a New York auction in May.Sotheby's said Double Elvis "epitomises the artist's obsessions with fame, stardom, and the public image".The life-size painting is one of 22 pieces Warhol dedicated to the singer, and will be shown in London, Los Angeles and Hong Kong before the sale.Eight Elvises was sold for $100m (£63.5m) in a private sale in 2008.The highest amount paid at auction for a Warhol was Green Car Crash, which went for $71.7m (£45.5m) in 2007.In the artwork, Presley is dressed as a gun-toting cowboy, while the double of the title refers to a shadowy image of the singer in the same pose.The painting was first displayed - along with the other artworks in the series - at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1963.The paintings encircled the gallery, reminiscent of early film, offering the artworks "a sense of motion, giving a cinematic quality to the paintings", Sotheby's said.The auction house said the Elvis series marked a turning point in Warhol's career, "where he made a transition from a viewer of movies to a maker of them".Of the 22 works in the Elvis series, nine are held in museum collections.
