Alejandro Sabella named as Argentina coach
Alejandro Sabella has been appointed Argentina coach following the removal of Sergio Batista.Sabella, 56, won the Copa Libertadores as coach of Estudiantes two years ago after a playing career that included stints at Sheffield United and Leeds.He had been set to take charge of Al-Jazira in the United Arab Emirates before Batista's exit last week.Argentina's quarter-final defeat by Uruguay when hosting the Copa America this month cost Batista his job.The general secretary of the Argentine Football Association, Jose Luis Meiszner, told official news agency Telam: "The decision has been taken. Sabella is the choice."Argentina have not won the Copa America or World Cup since lifting the Copa in 1993, although the country's Olympic team won gold at the 2004 and 2008 Games.The last two World Cup tournaments have ended in quarter-final defeats by Germany.
