A Briton and an Algerian died in the incident.The militants then took expatriates hostage at the complex, which was quickly surrounded by the Algerian army.Algerian state media said later that 685 Algerian workers at the plant had escaped, with reports that militants told them they were only targeting non-Muslims.
