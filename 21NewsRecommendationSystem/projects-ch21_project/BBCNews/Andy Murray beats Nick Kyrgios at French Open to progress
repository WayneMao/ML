Andy Murray beats Nick Kyrgios at French Open to progress
Andy Murray saw off the threat of big-hitting Australian Nick Kyrgios in straight sets to reach the fourth round of the French Open.Murray, seeded third, beat the 29th seed 6-4 6-2 6-3 in an entertaining match at Roland Garros.The 28-year-old British number one broke serve seven times as he won in one hour and 59 minutes.Media playback is not supported on this deviceHe goes on to the last 16 to face France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat Belgian David Goffin 6-3 6-4 6-2.Kyrgios, 20, produced several magical shots, including one superb lob from between his legs, but a final tally of 37 winners was matched by as many errors.He captivated the crowd on Court Suzanne Lenglen but never seriously threatened to avoid a third defeat in three meetings with Murray."I watch him quite a lot, so you go on the court expecting the unexpected," said the Scot."You just have to be on your toes at all times and try to be ready for something different."I feel like I have done a good job of weathering the storms that he always has during matches - periods in the matches where he's on fire and hits some unbelievable shots."But I just try to stay solid throughout and make it difficult for them."Murray was able to consistently threaten the Australian's huge serve, which was hampered by an elbow problem that required treatment in the final set."It's heartbreaking," Kyrgios said afterwards. "Today I wasn't near 100%."Not to take anything from Andy, he played unbelievable. I don't think he served well, but he made a lot of returns and he just does what he does best - that's make a lot of balls and mix up the game. He was too good."Murray managed only 54% of his first serves but kept his man moving with a barrage of early drop shots, breaking twice to take the first set which he closed out with a love hold."I hate this place," Kyrgios muttered jokingly early in the second when a call went against him.Murray increased the pain with a brilliant lob followed by a rasping backhand winner to grab the key break at 3-2.When Kyrgios fired a backhand long to fall 5-2 down, the second set - and with it surely the match - was slipping away.Murray pressed hard early in the third but could not convert three break points and Kyrgios moved 2-0 clear, only to hand his advantage straight back and smack a ball out of the stadium in anger.It was his last chance and Murray accelerated towards the finish line, firing a forehand into the corner to take a 4-3 lead and sealing victory with a fierce return winner."He's a freak athlete," added Kyrgios. "He's strong. I think that's how he has his advantage when he plays."
