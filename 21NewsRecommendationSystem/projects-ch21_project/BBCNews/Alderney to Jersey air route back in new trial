Alderney to Jersey air route back in new trial
Regular flights between Alderney and Jersey are set to return as part of a trial by Guernsey owned airline Aurigny.Flights are expected to launch in September and run on Friday and Sunday for a six-week trial period.Neil Harvey from the Alderney business, tourism and marketing committee said he would work to keep prices low.The last regular flights between the two islands were in 2009 and run by Blue Islands.Mr Harvey said: "The people of Alderney have long hoped for a resumption of the direct Jersey route and this gives up an opportunity to demonstrate just how successful it could be."I am really pleased that we can do this and grateful to Aurigny for their agreement to put on the planes."We are also planning a short TV advertisement which has been filmed here over the past few days and we will be hoping to persuade people in Jersey and Guernsey that they should come back to Alderney."Aurigny last operated flights between the islands in 2004.
