Aurigny jet software glitch causes tyre burst fears
A software glitch grounded a 122-seat jet after there were fears its tyres could burst on landing.Crew on the Aurigny jet noticed the brake light was flashing as it approached Guernsey Airport on Friday.Technical staff decided the flashing light was a "software issue" and the jet's tyres were not locked, which could have caused them to burst.Emergency services were put on standby, but the jet, which had travelled from Gatwick, landed safely at 21:35 BST.An Aurigny spokesman said: "Following an evaluation by the crew and our ground-based technical team, the crew confirmed that they could make a normal landing."Both cabin crew and passengers were kept fully informed of what was happening from the flight deck."The spokesman said Aurigny had contacted all passengers on the jet and many had praised the actions of the pilot and crew.Passengers scheduled to travel on the jet on Saturday morning were transferred to smaller planes while it was repaired. The aircraft has since returned to service.
