Audio slideshow: 'Pimp my matatu'
Kenya's minibus taxis, known as matatus - the country's main form of public transport - are renowned for their dangerous driving, blaring out music at deafening volumes and their elaborate, graffiti-style artwork, often based on leading footballers, singers or film stars.Owners and designers compete to have the loudest sound system and the most eye-catching design, saying this attracts customers but the government is trying to clamp down on them and has banned loud music and ordered matatus to have simple colour schemes.Graffiti artist Hassan "Rasta" Mohamed explains why Kenyans started to do up - or "pimp" their buses - and says he will resist the attempts to "destroy the matatu culture".Photography and audio by the BBC's Joseph Winter and Oscar Bunga.
