Artists have interpreted the human face to imaginative effect. What happens when a photographer tries
In the eyes of modern artists, the human form has become a design ripe for reappraisal. Exaggerating angles and skewing features, they have transformed our familiar features.It’s an approach people can take now with a click of a button with computer graphic applications such as Photoshop. But Hungarian photographer Flora Borsi has gone one step further – takingself- portraits inspired by classic modern art paintingsand morphing her features to resemble the artist’s original vision.“I found a photo with the models who were used inGrant Wood’s American Gothicstanding next to the painting,” Borsi, 20, tells BBC Culture. “Some artists use pure imagination to paint their artworks, others may prefer to create art by using a real life model as reference for the anatomy. What if these abstract models were real people?”Borsi chose a handful of well-known paintings as the basis of her photos, each of which features a human face transformed. “I selected paintings, where the model's anatomy or face were really distorted, or bizarre,” Borsi says. “Each piece took eight to 12 hours to produce. First I had to find the right clothing, accessories and make-up. After that, I took the photographs, and recreated the real one's detail with Photoshop.”Borsi’s recreations include a take on Picasso’s Woman With a Green Hat (1939) and Italian painter Mondigliani’s Portrait of a Polish Woman from 1919.“I was the model for this project. I made the makeup and styling,” Borsi says. “That was not easy, because I had to find the right angle, position, and facial expression for each painting.”Originally choosing four images, the pictures proved so popular with her online audience that she created another; a portrait based on Dutch artist Kees van Dongen’s The Corn Poppy (1919), a lurid portrait of a Parisian girl.It’s not the first time the photographer has caused a stir with one of her projects. Earlier this year, herTime Travellers projectsaw her Photoshopping herself into historical pictures – such as the Beatles arriving in the US and Silent comedy star Harold Lloyd hanging from a clockface high above a city street – adding herself in and incongruous spectator brandishing a digital camera.“The Time Travel series was exhausted after seven photos,” says Borsi, who plans to study photography at a university in Budapest. “In my opinion I won't continue any of my projects with a ‘part two’ - they are unique and unrepeatable.”If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.
