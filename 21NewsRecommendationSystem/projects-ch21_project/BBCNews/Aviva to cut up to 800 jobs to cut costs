Aviva to cut up to 800 jobs to cut costs
Insurance group Aviva has announced that up to 800 positions in the UK could be at risk as it continues its Â£400m cost-cutting programme.Redeployments and voluntary redundancies meant the actual number of people losing their job would be fewer than this number, the company said.Aviva said it had already streamlined senior management roles and would also create some new jobs.The Unite unions described the cuts as "totally unacceptable".An Aviva spokesperson said: "We've previously outlined plans to simplify our business and make it more efficient and agile."The vast majority of our employees will be placed into roles with little change. Up to 800 roles could be at risk, although in practice it will be fewer than that. There will also be some new roles in growth areas."We recognise this is a difficult time for employees and will do everything we can to support them as we continue with our consultation process."David Fleming of Unite said: "Our members face being asked to pay the price of boardroom failure and Unite is dismayed that what started out as a shareholders' revolt on executive pay will result in a jobs cull."This is totally unacceptable."
