Australian PM Kevin Rudd 'has learnt lessons from past'
Newly returned Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says he has learnt from his last experience as premier and will strive to consult with colleagues during his new tenure.Mr Rudd had previously been criticised for failing to consult on decisions.He was speaking at his first news conference, two days after he ousted Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader.Mr Rudd was sworn in as PM on Thursday, three years after he was forced out by Ms Gillard."One of the things I have learnt is the absolute importance of proper orderly consultation with cabinet colleagues on any major decision of the government," he said, adding he would take policy changes to cabinet first.Mr Rudd had been accused by his colleagues of running a "chaotic" and "dysfunctional" government when he was last prime minister.While he said he wanted to make some policy changes, he added there would be "no avalanche" of decisions.In his first speech to parliament on Thursday, Mr Rudd also called for a kinder and gentler politics.Mr Rudd returned to lead Australia's government three years and three days after he was toppled in a similar Labor leadership contest by Ms Gillard, then his deputy.An election is due to be held on 14 September, which polls suggest Labor will lose. But Mr Rudd is more popular with voters than Ms Gillard and many believe the party will perform better under him.Mr Rudd, however, said he would "identify a date for an election", suggesting that he would not stick to the date set by Ms Gillard.
