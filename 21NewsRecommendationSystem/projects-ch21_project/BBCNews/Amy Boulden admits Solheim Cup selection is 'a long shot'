Amy Boulden admits Solheim Cup selection is 'a long shot'
Welsh golfer Amy Boulden concedes time is against her as she attempts to to make Europe's Solheim Cup team to face the USA in Germany this September.The 21-year-old wasLadies European Tour (LET) Rookie of the Yearin 2014, but is 14th in the 2015 money list."It's a bit of a long shot right now, there's not many weeks left for it [the team] to be picked," she said.Sweden's Carin Koch will captain Europe in St Leon-Rot as they seek a third successive win.The top five players in the LET qualify by right, with another four being selected on the basis of the Women's World Golf rankings.The remaining three members of the team are captain's picks.Boulden will tee-off at the Deloitte Ladies Open in Amsterdam on Friday and says there will be three more opportunities to impress the selectors."Three weeks in a row I've got the Scottish Open, the British Open and then Prague the week after," added Boulden."Definitely a good performance in the British Open is something they're looking for."The best players in the world are there, you're competing against the Americans and it's good for your rankings and Solheim Cup points."The only other Welsh golfer to represent Europe at the Solheim Cup is Becky Brewerton, who played in the event in 2007 and 2009.
