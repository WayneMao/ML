All victims of Glasgow Clutha bar helicopter crash named
The names of all nine people who died when a police helicopter crashed into a busy Glasgow pub have been released.Robert Jenkins, 61, Mark O'Prey, 44, Colin Gibson, 33, and John McGarrigle, 57, were named on Tuesday.The other victims were Samuel McGhee, 56, Gary Arthur, 48, and the helicopter pilot David Traill, 51, and PCs Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg laid a floral tribute where the aircraft crashed into the Clutha bar on Friday.He was accompanied to the scene on Tuesday morning by Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson.Mr Clegg said the UK government was willing to help the city council, which has pledged to set up a fund for those people bereaved and injured in the tragedy."We stand ready to provide help if and when it is needed," he said."Of course we will continue to talk to them and work with the city council in any way we can to provide the help which they judge to be necessary."The deputy prime minister also paid tribute to the "exceptional" response of the people of Glasgow and the emergency services.He said everyone was full of admiration for how the city had come together and for the emergency services who "worked tirelessly in very difficult circumstances".With no further bodies having been found during the final phase of a recovery operation at the pub, focus is now turning to remembering the dead, helping the bereaved and survivors, and recognising the work of the emergency services.First Minister Alex Salmond has signed a book of condolence at Glasgow City Chambers and will make a statement on the tragedy in the Scottish Parliament later.He said: "I had a look at some of the messages when I was able to sign the book today and people are expressing sympathy, condolence obviously, as you would expect, but also solidarity."The theme running through the messages is one of solidarity. The citizens of Glasgow grouping round those who have suffered loss or injury and showing that they care, and the people of Scotland grouping round the citizens of Glasgow - it's solidarity that runs through the book of condolence."Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick said: "Our thoughts first and foremost are with the families and friends of all those who have died."As our investigation continues we will of course go on providing support to the families involved."She said the recovery operation had been "difficult and complex" and had involved "painstaking work and the skills of specialist personnel from across the emergency services".The family of Mr O'Prey had expressed their frustration at the amount of information they had been given about the recovery operation.Mr O'Prey and Mr Jenkins, both from East Kilbride, Mr Gibson, from Ayr, and Mr McGarrigle, from Cumbernauld, had all been inside the pub.Samuel McGhee, 56, of Glasgow, and 48-year-old Gary Arthur, from Paisley, Renfrewshire - who were earlier named among the dead - were also inside The Clutha.The three dead helicopter crew were pilot David Traill, 51, and PCs Kirsty Nelis, 36, and Tony Collins, 43.Eleven of the 32 people injured in the crash are still in hospital.The BBC understands that three are in a serious condition.Officers conducting the investigation have asked for any footage of the incident to be emailed to: glasgowhelicopterincident@scotland.pnn.police.ukEmergency services concluded the recovery operation with a "finger-tip" search of the building after the helicopter, which was embedded in the roof, was lifted out on Monday morning.The EC135 T2 aircraft, manufactured by Eurocopter, was loaded on to a lorry and taken to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) base in Farnborough, Hampshire.ByRichard WestcottBBC transport correspondentWe've now learnt some important details that will help to ascertain what caused this crash.For example, nothing fell off the helicopter before it came down, a rotor blade for instance, which is the first thing investigators would have checked.There was also no mayday call and the investigation team used the phrase "vertical descent" to describe its final moments. Both suggest that things went wrong very quickly.And the rotors appear to be intact, which suggests that they weren't turning very quickly as it hit the building. That points towards a loss of power.But there could still be a long way to go before we get the final answer. The fact that this helicopter wasn't fitted with a flight data recorder, a black box as they are known, will make the task much harder. It could have provided quick clues to any mechanical problems.The remains of the aircraft will now be painstakingly labelled and then examined at the headquarters of the Air Accident Investigation Branch in Farnborough.AAIB deputy chief inspector David Miller revealed on Monday that the pilot had not made a mayday call before its vertical descent.He said: "I can confirm that the helicopter does not have a flight data recorder. However, it does have a significant number of modern electronic systems on board and it may be possible to recover recorded data from those systems."There were no emergency transmissions from the pilot before this accident."Mr Miller said nothing detached from the craft in flight before the crash.Management of the incident scene has now been handed over from the emergency services to Glasgow City Council.The council's chief executive George Black said: "Every Glaswegian is immensely grateful for the work the emergency services have done for us since Friday night."And every Glaswegian is immensely proud of their fellow citizens who ran towards trouble when they were needed."While the initial response to this incident has now come to an end, we still have work to do."Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill and Community Safety minister Roseanna Cunningham have met officers and crews who took part in the rescue efforts.Ms Cunningham said: "The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service played a key role as part of the emergency services response which undoubtedly saved lives after the helicopter crashed on Friday night, the way in which they responded to an incident of this scale is truly exemplary."Air accident investigators have described this as one of the most complex crash sites that they've ever worked on."She added: "We are all indebted to their remarkable courage and dedication, working on a hugely complex operation, the relief effort from all of our emergency services has been simply heroic."Alasdair Hay, chief officer for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, paid tribute to fire and rescue staff.He said: "This incident was a very challenging, complex situation and I am extremely proud of my staff for such a dedicated and professional response."Whilst firefighters train for these sorts of emergency situations, the reality of actually dealing with them takes its toll on us emotionally and physically."It has been an extremely difficult time for everyone involved and I have the utmost respect for every single person who was part of this operation."
