Astrophysicist Sara Seager believes she has a way to reveal the biological secrets of a 'second Earth
Staring at the twinkling stars in the night sky, it’s easy to forget that those faint, distant lights are all suns. And, just like the fiery orb blazing away at the centre of our Solar System, those suns may have orbiting planets.It’s not like we can zoom in to look at the surface of an alien planet“We think there are upwards of hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy alone,” says astrophysicist Sara Seager. She is a born explorer, dedicating her life to the hunt for exoplanets far, far away with Earth-like conditions that could harbour life.But how will we ever know what planets outside the Solar System might support life? It’s not like we can zoom in to the surface to look – the distance is simply too great – and if an alien species wasn’t intelligent, it wouldn’t be broadcasting either.Seager, however, believes she has a way to spot biological signatures on exoplanets – and it involves a giant flower-shaped spacecraft capable of blocking out the light of an entire star.
