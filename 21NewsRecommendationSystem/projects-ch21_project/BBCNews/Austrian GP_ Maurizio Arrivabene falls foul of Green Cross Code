Austrian GP: Maurizio Arrivabene falls foul of Green Cross Code
Media playback is not supported on this deviceFerrari team boss Maurizio Arrivabene doesn't do uncool as a rule, but even he could not avoid looking a little foolish after ambling into the path of an oncoming Formula 1 carduring first practicein Austria.The silver-haired Italian obviously had other things on his mind - the car of Sebastian Vettel was in pieces in the garage at the time - as he hopped down from the Scuderia pit wall, looked left up towards the pit exit but not right towards the entry.Which was a bit of an oversight to say the least.As Arrivabene stepped down, the Williams of Felipe Massa came steaming out of his pit box. The two were on a collision course before both slung out the anchors.Modern F1 brakes being what they are, the Williams - and a bemused Massa - came to a near instant halt, while the Italian stallion rapidly gathered his hooves under him and skittered backwards out of harm's way.A glance was shared between the two men, Arrivabene's appearing to say: "Yeah, that was pretty dumb. Sorry mate."The 58-year-old was at least able to claw back some of his trademark cool as he proffered a Fonzie-like thumbs up to Massa as the Brazilian got back on the gas.Once backin the pits, Massa and Arrivabene could afford to share a joke about their near-miss.Although it's fair to assume the Ferrari chief will be getting a reminder from the powers-that-be - should he need one after a scare like that - to take extra care in one of the most dangerous environments in sport.
