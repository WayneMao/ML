Australia asylum: PNG judge probes rights at detention camp
Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court has begun a human rights inquiry into Australia's immigration detention centre on Manus Island.The probe will assess whether the centre's conditions meet human rights requirements under PNG's constitution.It comes ahead of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's visit to PNG on Thursday.In February, one asylum seeker was killed and dozens were injured after violence erupted at the centre.Australia sends asylum seekers arriving by boat for detention and processing in offshore camps in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific territory of Nauru.Conditions in these camps have been strongly criticised by UN agencies and rights groups.Reports say the investigation, initiated by PNG judge David Cannings, will examine what human rights, if any, the asylum seekers have, whether they are being granted those rights, and if not, how their rights can be protected.Around 30 asylum seekers will testify at the inquiry, PNG newspaper the Post-Courier reported.Both PNG and Australia launched investigations after violent clashes broke out at the centre on 16 and 17 February, the latter clash leaving one asylum seeker dead and 77 others injured.The first incident reportedly came after detainees were told that they would not be resettled in Australia.There were conflicting reports about what sparked the second outbreak of violence, and exactly where and how the asylum seeker, Iranian Reza Barati, died.Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison initially said that the violence happened after asylum seekers breached fences at the detention centre.He later revised his statement, saying that the clashes largely took place inside the camp's perimeters.Refugee advocates say the asylum-seekers were attacked inside the camp by local people and security personnel.Meanwhile, Tony Abbott will visit PNG from Thursday to Saturday, in his first visit to the country since becoming prime minister.The Manus Island detention centre is expected to dominate his talks with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill.In recent months Australia has taken a very tough stance in a bid to halt the flow of asylum seekers, who arrive by boat via Indonesia.Under a new policy, people found to be refugees will be settled in Papua New Guinea rather than Australia.Polls suggest a majority of Australians support the government's approach.
