Agreement protects CalMac workforce, says TSSA
A union involved in the CalMac dispute has said an agreement reached with the company and the Scottish government has ended a potential threat of job cuts.The breakthrough came late on Wednesday after four days of talks involving the ferry operator, the government and union representatives.The dispute was prompted by concerns about putting CalMac services in the Clyde and Hebrides out to tender.Transport Salaried Staffs' Association members were prepared to go on strike.The TSSA, which represents about 100 people working for CalMac, and the RMT, a union with hundreds of members at the company, have been in dispute with CalMac for months.Following the most recent round of talks, the unions said the new agreement had averted potential industrial action by their members.The TSSA said the deal meant there were would be no "slashing" of the workforce.A spokesman said: "TSSA stated that their aim to secure an agreement on employment, no forced redundancies and pensions were secured."TSSA welcomes this agreement, which will secure the services for the community in the Western Isles."The union said it would meet with CalMac next week for talks on protecting the terms and conditions of the company's temporary and seasonal employees.
