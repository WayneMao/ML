All London Underground cleaners get London Living Wage
All cleaners working on London Underground are now to be paid the so-called London Living Wage.The workers, who were employed by maintenance firm Tube Lines, will be paid Â£7.85 per hour, backdated to 1 July.They are the final group of Tube cleaners to be paid the wage.Transport for London (TfL) said the agreement to pay London Living Wage was made before it bought Tube Lines last month.Rail, Maritime and Transport Union general secretary Bob Crow said the outcome was a "tribute to the solidarity, bravery and resilience of our members and their reps" and would come as a boost to other low paid workers in the city.A TfL spokesman said: "London Underground is committed to paying the London Living Wage to all its employees."This reflects the mayor's campaign to encourage organisations to pay a fairer wage to those working in the capital."More than 100 London companies and local councils offer the London Living Wage to their workers.
