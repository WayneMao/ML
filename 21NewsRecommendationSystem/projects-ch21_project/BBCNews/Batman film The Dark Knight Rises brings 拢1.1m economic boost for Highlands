Batman film The Dark Knight Rises brings £1.1m economic boost for Highlands
Shooting scenes for new Batman film The Dark Knight Rises in the Highlands generated £1.1m for the local economy, it has emerged.Stunts for the movie starring Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy were performed in the Cairngorms last year.An ex-military transport plane used in the filming was also based at Inverness Airport.The amount of money the production brought to the Highland economy has been detailed in a new report.The paper, prepared for Highland councillors, said more than 200 crew spent two months in the area, using local services, suppliers and accommodation.A hangar at Inverness Airport was taken over during the shoot.The report said the movie's production manager was aware of the "quality of support" in the Highlands from his work on Mel Gibson's Braveheart in the 1990s.A "significant" animation film with a Highlands element could also be about to go into production with funding from China, according to the report.
