Gone but never forgotten. Watch over the rest of the lads".The bodies of the men are expected to be repatriated on Thursday.In Bradford a minute-long silence was held for Pte Kershaw at St Paul's in Buttershaw and the troops were remembered at services across the Bradford district.Huddersfield Parish Church held prayers during the morning services at 08:00 and 10:00 GMT.Eight churches across the Holme Valley were also open for prayers.
