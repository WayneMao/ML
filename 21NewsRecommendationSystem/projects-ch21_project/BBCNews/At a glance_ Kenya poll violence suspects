At a glance: Kenya poll violence suspects
Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto is on trial at the International Criminal Court, accused of organising violent attacks on members of rival ethnic groups following the disputed 2007 election. Originally, six people were accused, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, but charges against four of them have not been pursued. The violence broke out after Raila Odinga says supporters of ex-President Mwai Kibaki cheated him of victory.
