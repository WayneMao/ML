Assurances sought over Stena Line ferry jobs
Dumfries and Galloway MP Russell Brown is seeking talks with Stena Line over any potential job cuts due to a reduction in its ferry numbers.It is replacing the three vessels currently operating its Stranraer to Belfast route with two new craft.Mr Brown said he would "fight any job cuts" which might be associated with the changes.Stena Line said it would have a "surplus of seafaring staff" and it had started consultation with unions.The company is due to replace its current fleet, the Stena Caledonia, Stena Navigator and Stena Voyager with two new ships, Superfast VII and Superfast VIII on 21 November.Mr Brown said he hoped to have talks with Stena Line soon about the situation."We've just had the latest unemployment figures released and clearly the last thing our region needs is any more job losses," he said."I'm pleased that Stena want to consult on the way forward with employees and trade unions and they have shown a major commitment to our area with their new base near Cairnryan."But we will fight any job cuts and we're seeking an urgent meeting with the company to do that."
