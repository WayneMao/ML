Anglesey's £10m special needs school opens
A £10m special needs school with a hydrotherapy pool and sloping corridors has opened on Anglesey.Canolfan Addysg Y Bont in Llangefni has no lift of stairs but uses the site's natural gradient.Other "green" credentials include a wood pellet biomass boiler and photovoltaic panels.The two-storey building replaces the former Ysgol y Bont for students aged three to 19.Head teacher Andreas Huws said: "For both pupils and staff, this entire process has been a very exciting experience, as we were given the opportunity to view the site at different stages of its design and build."From the very beginning, the children have had a strong voice in how their new school should look, and through the school council, their ideas and suggestions helped to shape the building's design."Anglesey council leader Councillor Ieuan Williams said: "This has been a ground-breaking project for the local authority and hugely exciting for everyone associated with Ysgol y Bont.The Welsh government gave £7.7m to the school's construction.Opening the school on Thursday, Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "I'm pleased that this excellent new eco-friendly school is the result of collaboration between a range of partners, all with a shared interest in the education of Anglesey's special needs learners."This close cooperation has resulted in a building and facilities that will benefit young people on the island for years to come."
