Asif Kapadia ' who directed the documentaries Senna and Amy ' has created a new form of celebrity por
“I stumble from project to project,” says Asif Kapadia. “I don’t worry too much about planning.” The British film-maker directed Senna – about the racing driver Ayrton Senna, who died in 1994 – and Amy, which tells the story of the singer Amy Winehouse through a blend of home movies and archive TV footage.Scott Foundas, chief critic at Variety, believes he’s developed a new form of documentary: “It’s been a bit of an evolution for him, because he started out doing narrative features… he’s kind of reinvented himself now as this celebrity portrait maker, but in a very original style.”The director tells Tom Brook how that style came about, and how he feels about criticism from Winehouse’s father. “It’s our version of the story. It’s really hard to tell a life story in two hours.”If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.
