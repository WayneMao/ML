Bafetimbi Gomis: Swansea striker will get more goals - Garry Monk
Manager Garry Monk says Bafetimbi Gomis is showing the goalscoring form which persuaded him to sign the Frenchman last summer.Gomis' acrobatic volley doubled Swansea's lead against Hull City in the Premier League before his stoppage-time strikesealed a 3-1 win.It was the first time the Frenchman had scored in two successive games for the Swans since joining in June 2014."I can only see more goals for Bafe coming," Monk said."This is the reason why I brought him in - he can score goals in the Premier League."Gomis joined Swansea from Lyon last summer, but endured a difficult start to the season and did not score in his first eight league games.The former Saint-Etienne player raised doubts over his Swansea future in January after claiming on French television that the club had not fulfilled promises about the amount of playing time he would get.But Gomis took over as Swansea's main striker after Wilfried Bony's January move to Manchester City and has scored eight goals in all competitions.Media playback is not supported on this device"Goals always breed confidence in strikers," Monk added."I had no problem at all even when he wasn't scoring at the start of the season."He has the quality, which I knew all along. It's really pleasing to see him score these goals."He's played in the Champions League and scored 20-plus goals nearly every season in his career. He's a top-class striker and he scores different types of goals. You saw that from his finishes [against Hull] and the finishes he's done before."Swansea's win over Hull took them to within a point of their best Premier League points total of 47 with seven games of the season remaining.Monk said beating that mark, achieved in the 2011-2012 season, continues to drive his players on."Everyone has said we're not fighting relegation, we're not fighting for Europe - what are we fighting for?" Monk said."But we've got our own targets and our plan is to surpass that points total."I want more and they should want more,and I think they do."
