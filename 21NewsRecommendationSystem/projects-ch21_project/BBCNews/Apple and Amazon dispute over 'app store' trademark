Apple and Amazon dispute over 'app store' trademark
A US judge has approved Apple and Amazon's decision to end a two-year old lawsuit relating to the trademark of the term "app store".In 2011, Apple sought to block Amazon from using the term Appstore in its online shop for mobile devices.Amazon had argued the term was generic and that Apple did not own the rights."We no longer see a need to pursue our case against Amazon," Apple said in a statement.US District Judge Phyllis Hamilton signed the court order dismissing the case on Tuesday in Northern California, after earlier ruling that Apple hadn't proved that Amazon had deceived its customers by using the term."We're gratified that the court has conclusively dismissed this case," said Amazon in a statement.
