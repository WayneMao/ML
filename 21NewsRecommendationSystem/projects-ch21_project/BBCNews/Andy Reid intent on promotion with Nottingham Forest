We're not here just to make up the numbers, we're here to get promoted."The 28-year-old Republic of Ireland international said new Forest boss Steve McClaren was also a key factor in his decision tore-join the club he left in 2005."It's brilliant. It couldn't have worked out any better for me. If you had given me a pick of where to come this would have been the place," Reid added.I've worked really hard in the summer. I have done well in the tests and feel in good shape. I feel sharp"After speaking to the manager and hearing what he had to say, everything felt perfect about coming back."Promotion was one of the first words that the manager used in the chat with the players. It's all geared to promotion."The manager's here because he wants to get promoted, I'm here because I want to get promoted and play in the Premier League."Now I just want to get back to playing week in, week out and get back to producing what I know I can produce."I've worked really hard in the summer. I have done well in the tests and feel in good shape. I feel sharp."
