Batsman Alex Hales extends Nottinghamshire contract
Alex Hales has signed a contract extension that commits him to Nottinghamshire until the end of the 2014 season.Earlier this week Hales, 22, was named Young Player of the Year by the Professional Cricketers' Association.He passed 1,000 runs in the County Championship and was Notts' leading scorer in the t20 competition, winning a call-up to England's Twenty20 squad.Hales said: "Trent Bridge is a great place to play cricket."He continued: "Last season was good for me personally but the collective aim at Nottinghamshire is to push for honours in all three competitions."Signing Michael Lumb is a major boost for us and there are a lot of players within the squad who can have a big influence next season.Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Hales had become a key player in all formats of the game for the county."Alex has improved in every year he's been with us," said Newell."Twenty20 has proved to be his avenue into the England setup and he has ambitions to play Test cricket which will require him to score a high volume of runs over a sustained period of time in four-day cricket."
