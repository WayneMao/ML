Alex Gidman delighted with double century at Cheltenham
Gloucestershire batsman Alex Gidman says it was a "special" moment to score his first double century at Cheltenham.The hosts declared on562-5 on day twoagainst Kent at the annual cricket festival, with Gidman finishing on 211 - the highest first-class score of his 11-year career.He told BBC Gloucestershire: "To get my personal best and first double ton here is very special."It's certainly up there with my favourite places to play."Prior to Alex Gidman's exploits at Cheltenham, no Gloucestershire player had made a double century in nine years.New Zealand Test player Craig Spearman was the last player to achieve the feat - scoring a career-best 341 against Middlesex at Archdeacon Meadow, Gloucester in June 2004.Gidman, whose previous highest score was 176, became the first Gloucestershire player since Craig Spearman in 2004 to score a double hundred.The 32-year-old, who came through the county's youth team, had been captain at Bristol for four seasons beforedeciding to stand down at the end of last season.Gidman has been in fine form since handing over to overseas player Michael Klinger, averaging 62.83 in Division Two, scoring three centuries and two fifties."I'd never like to say that giving up the captaincy is the reason I've scored runs," said Gidman."There's probably two or three reasons, but I guess it would be a factor as I've had less things to concentrate on outside of my game."I'd take this, whether I was captain or not captain. It's nice to be contributing to the team and hopefully contributing to a win for us."
