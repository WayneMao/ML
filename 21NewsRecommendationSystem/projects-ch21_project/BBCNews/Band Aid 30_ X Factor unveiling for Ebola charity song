Band Aid 30: X Factor unveiling for Ebola charity song
The new Band Aid single has been broadcast for the first time.A video showing performers including One Direction, Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran singing the reworked Do They Know It's Christmas? was shown on ITV's X Factor.They were among the stars who recorded a cover of the 1984 song, to raise money to tackle Ebola, on Saturday.The current outbreak of the deadly virus was first reported in March and has killed more than 5,000 people, almost all in West Africa.The UK government has said VAT will not have to be paid on the single.Organiser Bob Geldof, who was also behind the 1984 original, said he addressed the participants "like the headmaster" before they sang the chorus."I explained the situation in West Africa, I explained what the UN were saying, explained what we could do, and just geed them up," he said.Speaking on X Factor to presenter Dermot O'Leary, Geldof described the new recording as a "little bit of pop history".He said the video - which began with shots of victims of Ebola - was "harrowing and not meant for an entertainment show" but was something the X Factor audience should see.Other artists taking part included Emeli Sande, Ellie Goulding, Sam Smith, Chris Martin, Elbow, Seal, Jessie Ware, Fuse ODG, Sinead O'Connor, Angelique Kidjo, Olly Murs, Paloma Faith, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Clean Bandit and Foals.Bono, who featured on the original 1984 version, was also involved, as were YouTube video stars Zoella, Alfie Deyes and Joe Sugg.Geldof had suggested the song and video shown on X Factor may not be the finished versions."We'll have a rough edit on the X Factor and we'll have a rough edit of the film," he said.The song will be available to download, costing 99p, from 08:00 GMT on Monday. A CD version will be released in three weeks, costing £4.Geldof and co-writer Midge Ure's first version of the song raised £8m for famine relief in Ethiopia. Do They Know It's Christmas? was recorded again in 1989 and 2004.The lyrics have been rewritten in parts for the new recording.It's Christmas time, and there's no need to be afraidAt Christmas time, we let in light and banish shadeAnd in our world of plenty, we can spread a smile of joyThrow your arms around the worldAt Christmas timeBut say a prayer, pray for the other onesAt Christmas time, it's hard but while you're having funThere's a world outside your window, and it's a world of dread and fearWhere a kiss of love can kill you, and there's death in every tearAnd the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doomWell tonight we're reaching out and touching youNo peace and joy this Christmas in West AfricaThe only hope they'll have is being aliveWhere to comfort is to fearWhere to touch is to be scaredHow can they know it's Christmas time at allHere's to youRaise a glass to everyoneAnd here's to themAnd all their years to comeLet them know it's Christmas time after allFeed the world, let them know it's Christmas time againFeel the world, let them know it's Christmas time againHeal the world, let them know it's Christmas time again
