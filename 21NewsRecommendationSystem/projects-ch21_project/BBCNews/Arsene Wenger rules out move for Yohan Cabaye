Arsene Wenger rules out move for Yohan Cabaye
Media playback is not supported on this deviceArsene Wenger says he will not make another move for Newcastle's Yohan Cabaye because he has enough midfielders at Arsenal.Cabaye, 27, was the subject of aÂ£10m summer bidfrom Arsenal, and Newcastle have said he is not for sale.Gunners manager Wenger said: "On Yohan Cabaye, we don't look for a midfielder."We didn't have Mesut Ozil or Aaron Ramsey and we still had three good midfielders and Mikel Arteta on the bench [for the 1-0 win at Newcastle]."Ramsey has a thigh injury while Ozil missed Sunday'svictory at St James' Parkwith a shoulder problem that could rule him out of the New Year's Day game against Cardiff.Arsenal's win, thanks to an Olivier Giroud goal, took them past Manchester City to top the Premier League at the New Year, the first time they have done so since the 2007-08 season.And after ending a run of three games without a win by beating West Ham at Upton Park on Boxing Day, Wenger said his side were showing the required character to mount a title challenge.The French manager told BBC Sport: "We played two away games and got six points against West Ham and Newcastle and as you can see the team is ready for a fight. So it's a good base. Let's keep fighting and keep trying to develop the team."Arsenal had to battle for the win at St James' Park with Newcastle hitting the bar in the first half and almost scoring late on when Wojciech Szczesny's clearance cannoned off Loic Remy and trickled wide of the goal.But in a sometimes bruising encounter, Giroud scored his 11th goal of the season to end a run of 499 minutes without scoring in the Premier League.And Wenger praised the balance that the striker brings to an Arsenal team chasing a first Premier League trophy in 10 season."He gives us a good structure up front as we are a short team," he said."We believe in ourselves and we are determined to give our best absolutely and to turn back on this season at the end and think we have given our best. I hope it will be enough but it's a long way to go."
