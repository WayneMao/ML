And we shall expect Mr Kalmadi to walk out either by the end of the day [Thursday] or tomorrow [Friday]," news agency AFP quoted Mr Kalmadi's lawyer Hitesh Jain as saying.In his bail petition, Mr Kalmadi cited the Supreme Court's recent order in the telecoms scandal which said that "bail is rule and jail is exception".The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Mr Kalmadi "for conspiracy to cause favour to a company in Switzerland while procuring timers and scoring equipment for the Games".Other charges related to contracts at a 2009 event in London which marked the start of a baton race across Commonwealth countries, say reports.If found guilty he could face years in prison. Mr Kalmandi denies the charges.VK Verma, the former director general of the Games organising committee, was arrested in February last year and accused of financial irregularities linked to the event.The row over the Games is one of a series of corruption scandals that has rocked India in recent months.
