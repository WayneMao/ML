Aurigny airline route share could lead to Guernsey job cuts
Guernsey airline, Aurigny, has not ruled out making pilots redundant as a result of a route-share with Blue Islands.The agreement means that passengers can pay for one ticket to Jersey, and then travel on either airline.Aurigny said a "small number" of pilot posts would be lost.Captain David Rice, Aurigny's director of flight operations, said the firm would, however, be hiring about ten people in ground handling operations.In January, the competition regulatory authority, CICRA, gave the airlines permission to share travel from Guernsey to Jersey for the next two years.The share means Aurigny will take some of Blue Island seats on Guernsey - Jersey flights.Aurigny will then pay Blue Islands a fixed charge for the seats.
