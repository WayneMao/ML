Health bosses in north Wales have published an action plan in a bid to improve a GP out-of-hours service following a critical report.The report,leaked to BBC Wales, revealed the service was understaffed and had a number of management issues.In response, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it plans to tackle unfilled shifts and have a better-structured management on-call rota.It comes after assembly membersqueried how the issues would be addressed.The initial leaked report, conducted by a team of consultants in March, included responses from 117 staff - 84% of which said they felt the service was "not safe" at times.The health board has since published a series of recommendations detailing how it will tackle the issues raised, with a number of them already carried out.The plan will go before a health board committee on Tuesday and the full board next month.
