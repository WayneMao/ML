Andy Murray semi-final at Queen's Club delayed until Sunday
Andy Murray will have to play twice in one day if he is to win a fourth Queen's Club title after his semi-final was suspended because of rain.The top seed and Serbia's Viktor Troicki were tied at 3-3 at the Aegon Championships, with the winner to play South African Kevin Anderson.Murray and Troicki will resume at 11:00 BST, and the final is scheduled to get under way at 14:25 at the earliest.The weather forecast suggests a clear day in west London on Sunday.Murray will hope to pick up where he left off against Troicki, having earned his sixth break point of a dramatic seventh game when the weather intervened.Troicki was being treated for a shoulder injury at the time following a heavy fall.The world number 25 had returned to the court and was preparing to try and fend off another break point when the rainfall became too heavy to continue.Murray, 28, has recent experience of playing twice in a day, having beaten Lukas Rosol and Roberto Bautista Agut on the Munich clay last month.The delay would appear to favour Anderson, the 6ft 8in world number 17 who has racked up 96 aces and dropped serve just once on his way to the final.Anderson, 29, beat France's Gilles Simon 6-3 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 in Saturday's first semi-final and must wait to learn his final opponent."Just for me it's a little strange not knowing who you're playing still and waiting around, but I can't really let that affect my preparations," he said."I will sort of treat it like a normal match."He added: "It's going to be a big match. I'm really looking forward to it. It's a tournament I remember watching at a very young age."I didn't really understand how the tour worked. Everybody knew Queen's, though, the week before Wimbledon and you had the best players in the world playing it."
