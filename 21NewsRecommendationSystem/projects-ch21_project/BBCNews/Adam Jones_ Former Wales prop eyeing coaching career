Adam Jones: Former Wales prop eyeing coaching career
Former Wales prop Adam Jones says he has ambitions to become a coach but wants to play on beyond next season.Jones, 34, will play his final game for Cardiff Blues against Zebre on Saturday beforejoining Harlequins on a one-year deal.The ex-Ospreys player, who will mentor Quins' younger players, said: "I don't want to chuck my boots in just yet."I didn't want to go there just as a coach. I want to play well this year and the next couple of years as well."He added: "The chance to help younger guys out does appeal to me and that's something, especially the scrummaging route, I'd like to go into when I finish."Jones started at Neath before joining the Ospreys when the region was formed in 2003 and won four Celtic League titles with the club.He left the Swansea-based region to sign for Cardiff Blues on aone-year deal in August 2014.The Abercrave-born front-rower has competed at the last three World Cups and was part of the Lions tours to South Africa in 2009 and Australia four years later.However, he announced his decision to quit international rugby earlier this year after failing to make Warren Gatland's Six Nations squad.He won 95 caps for his country and four Six Nations titles, including three Grand Slams.
