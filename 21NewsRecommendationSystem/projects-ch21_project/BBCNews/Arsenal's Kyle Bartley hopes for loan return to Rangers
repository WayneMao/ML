Arsenal's Kyle Bartley hopes for loan return to Rangers
Kyle Bartley would like a return to Rangers on loan next season and says talks are already in progress with parent club Arsenal.The 19-year-old defender was farmed out to Ibrox in January but missed the run-in to the Glasgow club's Scottish title success through injury."There are talks going on with Arsenal as we speak," he told Rangers' website."So we'll have to wait and see. But, if I'm told I can come back to Ibrox, that would be fantastic."Bartley made his Arsenal debut in the Champions League against Olympiakos in December 2009 but was subsequently loaned out to Sheffield United.The experience this year was invaluable and I really enjoyed my time at RangersFearing he would lose his place when the Blades signed experienced Scottish defender Neill Collins, he asked for a move and eventually joined Rangers.He impressed in nine appearances for the Scottish champions.However, his spell at Ibrox was cut short in March after he suffered a medial ligament injury that forced him out of the Co-operative Insurance Cup final win over Celtic.Now it appears that assistant manager Ally McCoist, who will succeed Walter Smith as boss this summer, wants him back in Rangers' squad for next season.Bartley had returned north to watch them end the season on top of the Scottish Premier League with a 5-1 win over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park."The experience this year was invaluable and I really enjoyed my time," added the Englishman."All the boys get on really well and they're all great lads and now they can celebrate this success together."
