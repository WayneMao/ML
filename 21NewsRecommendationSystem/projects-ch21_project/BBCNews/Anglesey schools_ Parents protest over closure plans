Anglesey schools: Parents protest over closure plans
Parents from three schools under threat of closure on Anglesey are protesting outside the island's council headquarters.Anglesey council says it must tackle the high number of surplus places in schools.Ysgol Ffrwd Win in Llanfaethlu, Ysgol Cylch-y-Garn in Llanrhyddlad and Ysgol Gynradd Llanfachraeth in Llanfachraeth are all at risk.But campaigners believe the wrong schools have been targeted.Education services on Anglesey were put into special measures in the summer after inspectors found them "unsatisfactory".The report by Estyn was critical of standards, low attendance, planning, and the quality of leadership at Anglesey.Liz Gillham, chair of governors at Ysgol Ffrwd Win, said: "There are 18 other schools on the island with more spare places than these schools."In the Estyn report, our schools have come out very well."There are about 130 pupils between the three schools and it's the parents who have instigated this protest - we are angry."
