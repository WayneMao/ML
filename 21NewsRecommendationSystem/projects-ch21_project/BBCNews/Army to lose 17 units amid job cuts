Army to lose 17 units amid job cuts
The Army will lose 17 major units as it cuts 20,000 regular soldiers by 2020, the defence secretary has said.Philip Hammond told MPs that the units to go included four infantry battalions and two sections in the Armoured Corps.He said the Army would be a "forward-looking, modern fighting machine", but Labour said the cuts were short-sighted and could put the UK at risk.The number of regular soldiers is set to fall from 102,000 to 82,000, while reservists will double to 30,000.The Army will be about half the size it was during the Cold War era - it had more than 163,000 troops in 1978.In the infantry, Mr Hammond said, no current regiments or cap badges would be lost.He said: "After inheriting a massive overspend from the last government, we have had to make tough decisions to implement our vision of a formidable, adaptable and flexible armed forces.ByJonathan BealeDefence correspondent, BBC NewsThe Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond has conceded that morale in the Army is "fragile". The scrapping of 17 units will not help. Nor will two more rounds of redundancies in the Army still to be announced.The next few years will involve a lot more pain. But the chief of the general staff does now at least have a clear sense of direction. The Army of 2020 will be smaller and more reliant on reservists.But there's the promise that troops will be well equipped and properly trained.There are still many unanswered questions.
