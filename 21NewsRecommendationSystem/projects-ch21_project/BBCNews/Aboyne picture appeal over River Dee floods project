Aboyne picture appeal over River Dee floods project
University researchers areappealing for picturesof recent flooding damage in the Aboyne Bridge area in a bid to help prevent a repeat.The University of Aberdeen team wants to crowd source information so they can build an accurate picture of how the River Dee flood waters caused by Storm Frank built up and drained away.The aim is to create a plot of the water level through time.They are working with Aberdeenshire Council and Sepa.Dr Clare Bond, one of the team, said: "In general the data for these charts come from gauges in monitoring stations along the river, but in order to build the kind of accurate 3D picture we're looking for we need help from people who took pictures of the flooding as it happened on the morning of 30 December."Every photo of the river will carry information on water level that will be useful as long as it retains information on the time and date on which the image was taken, which most smartphones and digital cameras do."Our aim is to crowd source multiple images of the same location, but taken at different times. Once we have this information we hope to produce a hydrograph that will provide us with the accurate information we need to work towards a solution."Imagescan be sent to deeflood@abdn.ac.uk
