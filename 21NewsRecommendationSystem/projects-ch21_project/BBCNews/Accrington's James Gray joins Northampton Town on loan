Northampton Town have signed Accrington Stanley striker James Gray on loan until the end of the season.The 22-year-old Northern Ireland Under-21 international has scored five goals this season, all of them coming in his first eight matches.But he has not scored in his last 12 appearances for the Cobblers' League Two rivals.He joined Conference side Southport on loan in February, buthis spell with them lasted just one training session.Gray - the son of former Sunderland, Luton and Northern Ireland striker Phil - joined Accrington in 2012.He is a product of the Middlesbrough youth system and went on to have spells at Darlington and Kettering."James is a player who has always caught our eye, whether playing against us or in games we have been watching," said Cobblers boss Chris Wilder."We think he will add something different to our squad. He is full of energy, he has pace and he can run in behind."He is also very aggressive, which is a trait I like, and he can be a real handful for defenders."
