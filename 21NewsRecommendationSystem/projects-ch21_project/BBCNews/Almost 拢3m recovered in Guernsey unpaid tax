Almost £3m recovered in Guernsey unpaid tax
Almost £3m is recovered in unpaid taxes in Guernsey, making it the largest amount collected in a single year, the States says.The money, which included unpaid income tax and the resulting penalties, was recovered after 162 enquiries were followed up by officials in 2012.Rob Gray, director of income tax, said it would be more difficult for the same people to evade tax again.He said that there had been six successful prosecutions since 2009.Residents are being urged to contact the States if they suspect other islanders of underpaying.
