Avon and Somerset PCC: Lib Dem Pete Levy to help addicts
The Liberal Democrat candidate for the Avon and Somerset police elections says he wants more help for drug addicts.Pete Levy says he wants common sense policing for drug and alcohol crimes which recognises addiction as a health issue.Mr Levy has been a Liberal Democrat councillor for the North Bristol ward of Horfield since 2010.He said while drug dealers should be locked up, addicts needed treatment not sentences for their problem.Mr Levy said: "I'm not talking about locking up addicts, but the dealers that are facilitating their addiction."Addicts need a different approach. By creating a circle of offending, punishing and re-offending, we are doing nothing about the root causes of these types of crime."Mr Levy had heard other candidates declaring zero tolerance on drugs."This is an empty, political slogan that does nothing about the root causes of crime."It is about education, prevention and rehabilitation, not just punishment," he added.Prior to being a councillor, Mr Levy worked as a constable for Wiltshire Police and spent six years in the Royal Military Police (RMP).He was also a member of the Avon and Somerset Police Authority but had step down in order to stand in the election.Ken Maddock has been chosen as the Conservative candidate for the Avon and Somerset election, Sue Mountstevens is an independent candidate and John Savage is the Labour candidate.Ian Kealey had represented UKIP but has since pulled out.
