It is very difficult for Nino and all her family," Jamie added."It happened so fast. Four months ago, she was getting married and looking forward to the rest of her life and now all that's gone."She was a great person, full stop, regardless of what she did on the tennis court and I think everyone that knew her will remember her very fondly. I'm sure her memory will live on."Baltacha and her husband launched theElena Baltacha Academy of Tennis in Ipswich in 2010."Hopefully that's something we as tennis players, because we have a responsibility, can help with and keep it going," said Wimbledon champion Andy."Hopefully with the Rally for Bally day later in the year we can raise a lot of money for her academy and that's the best thing that we can do right now for her and her family.Media playback is not supported on this device"But it doesn't change the fact that she obviously died way too young and it's a tragic tragic story."Jamie, who was speaking at the Madrid Masters after he and Australian partner John Peers lost 2-6 6-3 10-6 to Polish pair Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski in the first round added: "It is very sad, but it kind of puts things into perspective a little bit. You've got to make the most of every day you have because you never know when your last one might be."It is all just terribly sad and tough to sum up."
