Media playback is not supported on this deviceBritish number two Johanna Konta says the home crowd played a major part in her reaching the third round of the Aegon International at Eastbourne.The 24-year-old, who lives in the town,beat world number eight Ekaterina Makarovain straight sets."I'm proud of the level I was able to produce today," Konta told BBC Sport."The energy of the stadium was amazing. I really felt them pulling and rooting for me and I was really appreciative of that."Victory over Makarova, the winner at Devonshire Park in 2010 and the fourth seed, was the first against a top-10 players of Konta's career.The Australia-born world number 146 was pleased with the manner of her 6-2 6-4 success."She (Makarova) played well and I'm happy I was able to take the chances I created for myself," she continued."On paper it looks great but, in terms of the win, it's the same as the one I had on Sunday and I'm just happy I'm still in the tournament and I've given myself another opportunity to go out there and compete."Konta said being able to stay at home during the tournament was a boost, compared to travelling on the WTA tour."It's always a treat to be at home and play a tournament in the same week," she said."I get to stay in my own bed and see my parents and be a bit of a hermit outside tennis. I get to stay in my own little space and I enjoy that."Konta will face Spaniard Garbine Muguruza, the world number 20, in the third round on Wednesday.
