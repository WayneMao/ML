Of the 28 Celtic supporters held, 22 were freed - 10 without charge and 12 after paying fines.It is understood that the fines paid were up to 500 euros.Dutch Police said following the disturbances that eight officers were hurt after being attacked with bottles and sticks by Celtic fans.Some of the disorder was said by police to have been sparked by Dutch fans getting hold of a flag which Celtic supporters had been holding.Police Scotland said they were aware of disorder in Amsterdam and they would work with Dutch colleagues to identify anyone involved in the trouble.Celtic Football Club said there was "no excuse for any form of violent conduct" but stressed that many fans had been "subjected to a high degree of provocation".In a statement, the club said it was investigating the events.The statement said: "We have received numerous complaints from Celtic supporters in relation to their treatment in Amsterdam, which we will also investigate fully."The club added that the "overwhelming majority" of its supporters behaved impeccably.Before the Champions League game, which Celtic lost 1-0, the Scottish club urged its fans to be "extra vigilant" after a group of supporters were attacked in a city centre bar.It was reported that about 50 Celtic fans were in the Old Sailor Cafe in Amsterdam when they were attacked by a group of hooded men on Tuesday night.There were no serious injuries and a number of people were arrested.Meanwhile, Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Ajax over the alleged "discriminatory behaviour of their fans" during the game against Celtic in Amsterdam.The case will be dealt with by the Uefa control and disciplinary body on 12 November.It is believed the proceedings relate to an offensive banner which was displayed during the game.
