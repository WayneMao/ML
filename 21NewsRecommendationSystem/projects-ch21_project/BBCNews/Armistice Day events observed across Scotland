Armistice Day events observed across Scotland
Remembrance ceremonies have been held across Scotland to mark Armistice Day.The Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) had called for widespread observance of the two-minute silence at 11:00, which was held as a mark of respect for the war dead.Traditional gatherings in Glasgow's George Square and at the Edinburgh Garden of Remembrance were replicated across the country.More unusual tributes included a giant poppy on a horse statue on the M8.The annual event marks the time when World War I came to end in 1918.Millions of people across the UK observed the silence.Ceremonies commemorated those who died in two world wars and later conflicts, including 385 UK personnel killed in Afghanistan since 2001.Royal British Legion Scotland general secretary George Ross said: "The national coming together for a two-minute silence has been growing in popularity in recent years, when individuals can dwell on the debt of honour we owe the fallen as well as remember their deep sense of service."I like to see this as the country coming together as a family to remember those in the national family that paid the ultimate sacrifice."This is an important year for us. Both the Royal British Legion Scotland and Scottish Poppy Appeal celebrate their ninetieth anniversaries, plus, of course, 2011 marks 10 years of operations in Afghanistan."The call for a two-minute silence remains as powerful and relevant as ever."Other groups marked the occasion in a unique way.A group of 11 hillwalkers paid their respects at the peak of the 11th highest Munro at 11:00 on Armistice Day, the 11th day of the 11th month.They were at the top of Beinn a Bhuird, near Braemar in the Cairngorms, to observe the customary two-minute silence.Meanwhile, traffic was stopped in Inverness city centre - the first time this has happened on Armistice Day since World War II.
