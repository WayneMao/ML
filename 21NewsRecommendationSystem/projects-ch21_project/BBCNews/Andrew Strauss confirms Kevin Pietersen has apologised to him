On Friday Pietersen said hehoped to be back for February's tour of New Zealand.Speaking atthe Professional Cricketers' Association end-of-season awards in Battersea,Strauss toldBBC Radio 5 liveSport: "It was good that we spoke and got a few things out in the open."We've always been good friends. It was an awkward time this summer for all sorts of people."I will have no problems meeting up with Kevin and having a beer with him, definitely."We've been through a lot together, we've had huge shared experiences, and nothing changes in that respect."After the talks, Cook said he was hopeful that the 32-year-old will return to international duty, but reiterated that: "If the issues can be resolved, Kevin has said he is available for selection, but at the moment that can't happen."Discussions between Pietersen and the England and Wales Cricket Board have beenongoing since the second Test against Proteas at Headingley,when the Surrey man himself cast doubts on his future -a claim he later backtracked from.
