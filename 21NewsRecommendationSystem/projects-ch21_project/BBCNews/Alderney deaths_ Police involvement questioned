Alderney deaths: Police involvement questioned
Politicians have questioned whether it was necessary to involve police in the investigation of four deaths at a hospital in Alderney.Guernsey Policeinvestigatedthe deaths at the island's hospital, but found no action was needed.The deaths occurred in the Mignot Memorial Hospital. It is run by Guernsey's Health and Social Services Department, which called in the police.The policy and finance committee says it wants to "establish the facts".Neil Harvey, its chairman, said: "It is essential that the people of Alderney can have confidence and trust in those who have responsibility for delivering health services on the island."Recent events, as yet not properly explained, have severely dented that trust and we believe only an independent enquiry will restore confidence in the system."A statement from the committee said the decision to involve police had caused "considerable disquiet", but it welcomed news "no further action is to be taken by the police".All four patients had been under the care of Dr Rory Lyons, who remains under an interim suspension while the General Medical Council carries out its investigation.He is one of four doctors in Alderney - the other three work at the Island Medical Practice - and before his suspension he dealt with about 500 patients from the island's 1,900-strong population.
