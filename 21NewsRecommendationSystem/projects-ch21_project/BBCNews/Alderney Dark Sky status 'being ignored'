Alderney Dark Sky status 'being ignored'
A campaigner hoping to get Dark Sky status for part of Alderney says the island's government has shown "complete indifference" to the idea.Ken Hampton said the west of the island could meet the International Dark Sky Association's criteria at little cost.He said such an accolade could help the island attract more tourists, which happened in Sark after it was named the world's first Dark Sky Island.The States of Alderney told the BBC the idea was "being actively considered".Mr Hampton said by following Sark in holding astronomy festivals it would bring a different group of tourists to the island.He said: "There is a bit of work that goes into it, which is something a few of us volunteers are perfectly happy to go and do."Sark spent a few thousand pounds in developing their lighting plan... the Dark Sky guys have provided me with a lighting plan... all we have to do is a bit of editing on the document and rubber-stamp it."
