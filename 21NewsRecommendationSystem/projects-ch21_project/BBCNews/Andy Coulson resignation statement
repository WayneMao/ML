Andy Coulson resignation statement
The full statement issued by Downing Street's director of communications Andy Coulson:"I can today confirm that I've resigned as Downing Street director of communications."It's been a privilege and an honour to work for David Cameron for three-and-a-half years."I'm extremely proud of the part I've played in helping him reach No 10 and during the coalition's first nine months."Nothing is more important than the Government's task of getting this country back on its feet."Unfortunately, continued coverage of events connected to my old job at the News of the World has made it difficult for me to give the 110% needed in this role."I stand by what I've said about those events but when the spokesman needs a spokesman, it's time to move on."I'll leave within the next few weeks and will do so wishing the prime minister, his family and his brilliant and dedicated team the very best for what I'm sure will be a long and successful future in government."
