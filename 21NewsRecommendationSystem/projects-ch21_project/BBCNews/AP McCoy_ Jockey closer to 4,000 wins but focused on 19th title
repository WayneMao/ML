I'm not sure how many more days I will be back at Down Royal," said McCoy, who is the only jump jockey to have ridden more than 3,000 winners in his career."Obviously it is nice to ride 4,000 winners.  It's something I would be very proud of if I was able to achieve."He is expected to have 13 chances of adding to his tally over the weekend, with seven Wetherby rides on Saturday and six Sunday bookings at Carlisle, but is not predicting when he might reach the landmark."You've got to look at [paralysed riders]John Thomas McNamaraor Jonjo Bright to realise you take it day by day as a jump jockey," he told BBC Northern Ireland."My aim at the beginning of the season is to be champion jockey and this year was no different. It's a good benchmark as to where you are in your career."
