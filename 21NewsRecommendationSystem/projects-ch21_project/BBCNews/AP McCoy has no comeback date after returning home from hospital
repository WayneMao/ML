AP McCoy has no comeback date after returning home from hospital
Champion jump jockey AP McCoy has no comeback date scheduled yet after spending seven nights in hospital with broken ribs.The Northern Irishman was injured in a fall at Cheltenham on 18 April and was allowed home from Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on Thursday.McCoy told BBC Sport he was "not sure" when he might return to action.McCoy, 38, will officially be crowned champion jockey for the 18th successive year on Saturday.It is unclear whether he will be fit enough to travel to Sandown for the end-of-season prize giving, with the 2013-14 season beginning the next day."He is progressing well," personal assistant Gee Bradburne said."He could have come home last Friday but the consultant felt that the extra care AP could have by staying in the hospital would contribute to a quicker recovery."On behalf of himself and his colleagues AP would like to express how grateful they all are for the excellent medical care that is on hand at the racecourses. It is very much appreciated."
