Aberdeen's City Garden Project: Fresh councillor row breaks out
A fresh row has broken out between two senior Aberdeen councillors over the controversial City Garden Project.A full meeting of Aberdeen City Council will discuss the Union Terrace Gardens proposals on 22 August.SNP leader Callum McCaig wants the audit and risk committee - which he chairs - to examine the business case for a £92m loan at a meeting next week.But the Labour Party insist it will go to the meeting of the full council in August.Labour group secretary Willie Young said Mr McCaig could be removed from his post if he did not accept the decision.Mr McCaig said the matter deserved to be fully scrutinised.Tax Incremental Financing(TIF) would see the £92m loan being paid back by increased income from business rates.Businessman Sir Ian Wood has pledged £50m of his own money to the project, a project he believes the city must grasp.In a referendum earlier this year, residents were asked if they wanted to retain the gardens or back the City Garden Project redevelopment.More than 86,000 votes were cast online, by post and by phone.There were 45,301 votes in favour of the project, with 41,175 people opposed to the plans.If it goes ahead, the project could be finished by 2017.
