Analysis: Legal challenge to Scotland's minimum alcohol price plan
A judicial review of the Scottish government's minimum pricing legislation is scheduled to begin at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday.The Scottish Parliamentpassed the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012on 24 May 2012.Scotland's then health secretary Nicola Sturgeon described it as an "historic moment", adding that "tackling alcohol misuse is one of the most important public health challenges that we face in Scotland".The minimum price itself was not contained in the bill (it will be specified through regulations) but the Scottish government said it would initially be set at 50p per unit, meaning the cheapest bottle of wine would be £4.69 and a four-pack of lager would cost at least £3.52.The bill received royal assent on 29 June 2012.But Ms Sturgeon's spokesman indicated that the measure would not actually come into force until April 2013 at the earliest. This was to allow for a period of consultation with the European Commission, amid claims that the plans were contrary to EU law on free trade.The Scottish government said it believed the plans were legal - arguing in essence that measures to tackle serious public health problems are exempt from competition regulations - and that it was hopeful of securing approval from the EC to go ahead.But on the 19 July 2012 the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) confirmed it wouldchallenge the legality of the plans in the Scottish courts, claiming that the legislation breached EU trade rules by distorting the drinks market.It claimed the policy would push up the price of 85% of blended Scotch whisky and that it could cost the industry some £500m in exports.The Scotch Whisky Association and the European Spirits Organisation have now been granted judicial review of the legislation. The case will be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh in a six-day hearing scheduled to begin on 23 October. The judgment will be reserved to a later date.The petition submitted by the two bodies argues that the minimum pricing legislation is "not law" for the following reasons:The petitioners argue that ministers should be prevented from implementing the Act while the judicial review and any other legal challenge, including any challenge in the European courts, is considered.In a response to the petition, the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland argues that:Meanwhile, a separate process is unfolding in Brussels where the European Commission has sought the opinions of member states on the Scottish government's plans.Five countries have issued detailed opinions. They are all major wine producers: Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal, Spain and France. Eight member states have commented (Bulgaria, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, Germany and Ireland).While the contents of the opinions and comments are confidentialthey have been widely reported as being hostile. The EC itself has said "what we can say is we have a problem with the compatibility of minimum pricing plans under community law".The opinions, along with the opinion of the Commission itself, have been sent to the Scottish government which now has until December 27 2012 to respond.It will then receive a response from the EC. If member states are unhappy with the EC's final response they could choose to challenge the legality of the measure at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.The UK government, which is proposing minimum pricing for alcohol in England and Wales, indicated on 1 October 2012 that it wouldsupport the Scottish government in arguing for the legality of the measure in the courts. The UK's Advocate General, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, said ministers would not "sit on the sidelines".A Scottish government spokesman said on 4 October that they would wait for the outcome of the Court of Session hearing before deciding how to proceed. They would not introduce the measure before the court had ruled, even if this delayed it beyond April.The spokesman said they had not yet decided how to respond if the measure ended up being challenged in the European Court of Justice.
