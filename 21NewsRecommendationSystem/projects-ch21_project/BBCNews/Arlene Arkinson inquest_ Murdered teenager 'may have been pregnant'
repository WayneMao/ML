Arlene Arkinson inquest: Murdered teenager 'may have been pregnant'
An inquest into the murder of County Tyrone schoolgirl Arlene Arkinson has heard she may have been pregnant at the time she went missing.The 15-year-old disappeared in 1994 after a school disco in County Donegal.She was last seen in a car driven by convicted killer Robert Howard, who was acquitted of her murder in 2005.The long-delayed inquest, which opened in Belfast on Monday, heard she was a bright but vulnerable girl who had been sexually abused in her younger years.The coroner's court was told Arlene was from a troubled background and her brother-in-law, Seamus McGale, was convicted and jailed for abusing her in 1993.  He was released 10 days before she went missing.The inquest also heard Arlene's mother died when she was 11, her father had battled an alcohol addiction and the teenager had gone missing several times.A barrister for the coroners service told the court that on the night of her disappearance:  "She was confiding in some friends that she was pregnant and that the father was a person closely connected, but not a member of the Arkinson family."The inquest heard the person with whom Arlene was last seen was Robert Howard, a man with a string of convictions for sex assault and rape.The court was told Howard was an an "extremely dangerous man" who posed a serious threat to vulnerable girls, but that he was "not the only person who had wronged her or to whom she was vulnerable".The coroner has not ruled on information that police do not wish to be made public as that evidence has not yet been presented to the court.Last week,the Northern Ireland Office approved a request from the PSNI to withhold documentslinked to the case.Northern Ireland Office Minister Ben Wallace approved a Public Interest Immunity (PII) application to withhold documents linked to the case.PII applications can be used when it is believed disclosure of state documents could be harmful to the public interest, such as concerns over national security or police informers.However, the coroner will take the final decision on whether the PII application will be granted.The Arkinson family have said they cannot understand why it has been requested and speaking outside court, their solicitor, Des Doherty, said it was "bizarre in the extreme"."There is absolutely no reason for it whatsoever, as far as we can see at the moment, unless there is some justification that can be brought before the court because ultimately the judge in this case - the coroner Mr Sherrard - will have the final say."Arlene's sister, Kathleen, is due to give a personal statement to the hearing, which is being heard without a jury.Timeline - child killer Robert HowardHoward, who remained the main suspect in the Arlene Arkinson murder investigation, died in prison last year aged 71.In 2005, he was found not guilty of murdering the schoolgirl.The jury was not informed during his trial that, by then, Howard was already serving life for raping and killing English schoolgirl Hannah Williams in 2001.
