Army of Action Man figures used for exhibition in Derby
An artist has enlisted the help of 300 Action Man figures for a new exhibition.Sculptor Ivan Smith arranged toys he collected as a child and added to his collection from jumble sales, charity shops and friends' lofts.The Action Man dolls are used throughout his Con-flict exhibition which focuses on global warfare.One part of the exhibition at Derby Museum and Art Gallery features 170 figures in various outfits.It took Smith, from Belper, Derbyshire, five years to collect enough dolls for the installation.He said: "I liked the idea of playing with something nostalgic and childlike and using it in a more sophisticated and adult way."So it's taking something perhaps a bit innocent and naive and making it slightly unnerving."Smith specialises in using recycled materials for his work and once arranged 19 fans next to a leaning tree.Con-flict will be on display at Derby Museum and Art Gallery until 10 July.
