Bangor fibre superfast broadband box installed
A superfast broadband street box is being installed in Bangor as part of a project to ensure all parts of Wales can access faster internet speeds.Superfast Cymru, funded by the UK and Welsh governments with BT, aims to ensure places that do not currently have superfast broadband can access it.The fibre broadband cabinet will be unveiled in Bangor on Friday ahead of plans to launch superfast broadband in the city as early as spring.The project aims to boost the economy.Other locations to benefit from the scheme include Caernarfon, Dolgellau, Menai Bridge, Porthmadog, Pwllheli, Ebbw Vale and Tredegar.Communications Minister Ed Vaizey said it represented the "dawn of a new age" for superfast broadband in Wales.Engineers will ultimately lay around 17,500km of optical fibre cable and install around 3,000 new fibre broadband cabinets in streets across Wales to improve broadband speeds and benefit homes and businesses.Mr Vaizey said the project will deliver fibre based broadband to 96% of homes and businesses in Wales by the end of 2015."The project will also create an estimated 2,500 full time jobs, and is a reminder of the massive contribution to economic growth that the government's nationwide roll-out of broadband continues to make," he added.Welsh government Business Minister Edwina Hart said it was an important milestone in extending fibre broadband to parts of Wales that are not covered by the private sector's commercial plans.She said: "Superfast Cymru will transform the broadband landscape across Wales, making the country one of the most connected countries in Europe."The Welsh government is providing £58m for Superfast Cymru with a further £57m coming from the UK government.BT is investing approximately £220m in Welsh fibre broadband with most of that going towards the Superfast Cymru project.
