Aberdeen retail scheme may not be repeated
A pioneering scheme aimed at supporting new businesses in Aberdeen may not be repeated.The winners of Retail Rocks were given empty shop units rent free for a year in the Torry area, plus ongoing business support.Council officials were instructed to find other areas of the city where it could operate.However a report to next week's meeting of the planning committee says no funding opportunities currently exist.The report recommends councillors agree Â£5,000 of funding toward further investigations.The Retail Rocks scheme, backed by the public and private sector, was the first of its kind in Scotland.
