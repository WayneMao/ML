AC Milan interested in Chelsea striker Didier Drogba
AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani says he would like to sign Chelsea striker Didier Drogba on loan in January.The Italian giants are short up front afterAntonio Cassano was ruled out for six months following heart surgery.Galliani would also like to sign Nicolas Anelka or Mario Balotelli but admits Drogba is his first choice."I have been in love with Drogba since he was playing with Marseille," Galliani toldLa Gazzetta dello Sport.The San Siro club have made a solid start to Serie A this season and lie in third - just one point behind early pace-setters Lazio and Udinese.They have scored 31 goals in their 10 league matches so far but Cassano's illness has left them short on options.Drogba has only made seven appearances for Chelsea this season, scoring just once.He was sent off on his last outing against QPR on 23 Octoberand iscurrently sidelined until 20 November following arm surgery."It's not a given that someone will come in January," added Galliani. "If they do it will be on loan because I promised Cassano we will keep his place for him."Anelka is an important player but I think it would be impossible for any Italian club to sign Balotelli at the moment."Manchester City striker Balotelli spent three controversial years at Inter Milan and provoked anger when he was pictured wearing an AC shirt on a television show.
