Arrests after early morning drug raids
Thirteen people have been arrested after a series of drug raids across central Scotland.Police Scotland said they had seized drugs and cash in the early morning raids on Tuesday as part of a "day of action".The arrests came after "extensive surveillance and intelligence gathering" over the past six months, police said.Nine properties were searched in Stirling, Falkirk and Clackmannanshire.The raids were part of "Operation Core", which was launched in August to tackle people involved in drug dealing.Officers recovered about £13,000 of diamorphine, as well as cannabis and diazepam. More than £700 in cash was also seized.Eight men and five women were charged in connection with the finds and are expected to appear in court on Wednesday.Following the raids, the NHS Forth Valley Drug and Alcohol Partnership offered support to people in the area who have been affected by the misuse of drugs.Ch Sup John Hawkins said: "When we launched Operation Core we made a promise to our communities to tackle the issues that were most adversely affecting their areas and to work alongside our partners to address these matters."Tuesday's activity is further proof that we are committed to improving the quality of life for residents within Stirlingshire, Falkirk and Clackmannanshire."
