At home we just haven't been good enough," he said."We need to get our fans behind us and get the emotion right. You can feel Stamford Bridge has become anxious."We therefore need support. We need atmosphere to get us past this period."We have two big games at home where we need our fans behind us and I'm sure they'll do exactly that."Chelsea's Â£50m British-record signing Fernando Torres once again struggled desperately and Villas-Boas hinted strongly that he will be back on the bench for the weekend trip to Newcastle.He said: "I think with Fernando it must come with confidence and time. We believe in him and we will continue to pursue his individual form."Fernando faces tough, tough competition and against Newcastle we will most likely go back to 4-3-3."Media playback is not supported on this deviceLiverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted with his side's victory but took a swipe at competition organisers for the scheduling of matches that forced the Reds, Manchester City and Crystal Palace - who take on Manchester United on Wednesday and are then in action again on Friday - to play two games in three days."The way we're progressing is more significant than reaching the semi-final of a cup that's been cheapened by the actions of the people who run it," he said."But that doesn't mean to say we wouldn't love to win it. We've got our reward and we'll look forward to the next game."Three teams in the quarter-finals have problems with fixtures. Do us a favour."I'm not clever but I think I could have avoided that. The solution is to get someone a brain."For updates throughout the day follow . Have your say on this story using Twitter via the hashtag
