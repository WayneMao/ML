Alastair Cook in runs as Essex edge Surrey
Alastair Cook warmed up for England's first Test with Sri Lanka with a half-century on day one of Essex's game against Surrey at Whitgift School.The left-hander made 63 before being caught behind off fellow Ashes winner Chris Tremlett, who had earlier bowled Jaik Mickleburgh for one.Matt Walker (76) and Adam Wheater (64) then added 131 for the fourth wicket.James Foster (30) and Graham Napier (25 not out) also contributed as Essex moved to 318-6 at the close.BBC Essex's Dick Davies:"Despite losing the toss and being asked to make first use of a greenish wicket at the delightful Whitgift School, Essex enjoyed their best day of Championship cricket so far this season."A commanding innings of by Alastair Cook clearly demonstrated his international pedigree and this laid the foundation for Matt Walker and Adam Wheater to enjoy the afternoon session as the wicket appeared to ease."James Foster would have been disappointed not to be at the wicket by the close but with Graham Napier, batting in somewhat cavalier style, and Tim Phillips, adopting a more cautious approach, still together, they will be looking to add to their 318-6 in the morning."
