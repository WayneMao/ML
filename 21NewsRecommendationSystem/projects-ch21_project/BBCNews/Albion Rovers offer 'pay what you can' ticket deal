Albion Rovers offer 'pay what you can' ticket deal
Albion Rovers are to trial a "pay what you can" initiative for Saturday's home game with Montrose.Supporters of the League Two club and visiting fans are being asked to fork out what they can afford for a ticket, with a minimum £1 entry."Since I took over in September I've been looking at ways in which we can re-engage with the local community," chairman John Devlin told BBC Scotland."I think a lot of potential football fans are put off by high pricing."Devlin was inspired by asimilar experiment at Brentford in December."We've looked at the type of support we would normally get at this time of year - coming after the Christmas and New Year holidays, when finances are tight," he added."We thought it was an ideal opportunity for such an initiative and basically see how it goes, to see if we can generate more interest."The normal adult price of admission is £10, with concessions at £5 and under-16s at £2.Rovers, who knocked Motherwell out of the Scottish Cup at Hamilton's New Douglas Park, sit fifth in the league and their biggest gate at Cliftonhill so far this season was 538 - against Queen's Park on 28 December.
