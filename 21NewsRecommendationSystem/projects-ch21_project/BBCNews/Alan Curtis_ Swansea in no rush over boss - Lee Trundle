Alan Curtis: Swansea in no rush over boss - Lee Trundle
Swansea City will not rush to appoint a permanent manager thanks to caretaker boss Alan Curtis' performance, says the club's former striker Lee Trundle.Curtis, 61, has taken five points from five games sinceGarry Monk's sackingand it now looks likely he will remain in charge for the rest of the season.Swansea are 17th in the Premier League, two points above relegation, after Saturday's loss at Manchester United."It's a massive decision that Swansea don't want to jump into," Trundle said."I think the board feel, with Alan in charge at the moment, they're not in a position where they need to jump into something which could hinder the club in the long run."Alan has come in and done extremely well. All the lads instantly respect him."Former Sunderland boss Gus Poyet had been tipped to replace Monk, while Brendan Rodgers has been linked with a return to his old club, but Swansea ambassador Trundle believes more managers will be available in the summer."The board are doing what's best for the club and you've got to respect that because, over the years, they've always got it right," he added."If we can't find that fit at the moment for both parties, you've got to keep searching."Swans chairman Huw Jenkinstravelled to South Americalast month as he stepped up his search for Monk's successor, with Argentina's Marcelo Bielsa then the favourite for the job.Former Premier League manager Neil Warnock, who took caretaker charge of Championship side QPR before the appointment of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, says there is less pressure on a temporary boss."Being an interim boss gives you freedom - I loved every minute of it," Warnock toldBBC Radio Wales."The problem Alan will have is if he gets the job."When you're actually totally put in charge, it is a totally different ball game. That's when results have to change."Swansea face Oxford United away in the FA Cup on Sunday before two crucial home Premier League games against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 13 January and Watford five days later.Warnock feels it would "not be advisable" for Swansea to clarify Curtis' future before those "two huge games"."I wouldn't want it to consume Alan. He deserves better than that for the role that he's done," the 67-year-old added."It is a game of poker, these next few days, whether they will, whether they won't."Former Wales striker Iwan Roberts believes the January transfer window will be a significant factor in Jenkins' mind."It's a massive decision to make because we all know how important this month is. Swansea need new players," Roberts said."If Huw Jenkins is going to make that decision that Alan is the man until end of season, does he give Alan money, knowing that he's not going to be manager next year?"The one concern I have - it is just one win in the five games."
