When we walk out at the venues and they announce the England team led by me, it's a great feeling. But you've got to be winning games of cricket."Following England's single ODI against Scotland, they will play a five-match series against Sri Lanka.England ODI squad:Alastair Cook (Essex, captain), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), James Anderson (Lancashire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Ravi Bopara (Essex), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Harry Gurney (Nottinghamshire), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Joe Root (Yorkshire), James Tredwell (Kent), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire).Scotland ODI squad:Kyle Coetzer (captain), Freddie Coleman, Matthew Cross, Josh Davey, Alasdair Evans, Majid Haq, Michael Leask, Matt Machan, Calum MacLeod, Preston Mommsen, Safyaan Sharif, Rob Taylor, Iain Wardlaw.
