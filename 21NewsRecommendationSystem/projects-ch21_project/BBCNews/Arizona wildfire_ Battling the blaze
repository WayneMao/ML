Arizona wildfire: Battling the blaze
The 19 firefighters killed in Arizona's wildfire were part of an elite crew known for tackling the area's worst blazes.The interagency "hotshot" team - of which there are a number across the US - are highly trained and equipped to work in remote areas at ground level for long periods with little support.Under heavy protective clothing, their main task is to create a firebreak between people and the fires by removing brush, trees and anything that might burn in the direction of homes and cities.To achieve this they carry a range of equipment.Source:National Interagency Fire CenterArt Morrison, of the Arizona State Forestry Commission, told CNN the hotshot crew in Arizona was "digging a fire line" - removing fuel from the path of a wildfire - when the fire overtook them.The team - without anywhere to escape - was forced to deploy emergency shelters, intended to shield them from the fast-moving flames, he explained.The shelters - made of a fire-resistant material - are regarded as the last line of defence for a firefighter against advancing flames. Firefighters are advised to dig a hole and climb into it inside the protective tent, allowing the fire to pass over them.However, Dan Fraijo, fire chief in the Arizona city of Prescott, said there was only a "50% chance" of survival.About 200 firefighters are continuing to fight the Arizona wildfire - started by a lightning strike - and more crews are on their way.They will include helicopters and other aircraft, which can drop thousands of litres of water or fire-retardant chemicals from low altitude."Smokejumpers" - rapid-response units who parachute into inaccessible areas to tackle blazes - are also often deployed.Despite their skill, the difficulty of the firefighters' task is often directed by the weather.The most damaging fires occur in hot, dry and windy conditions. Gusty winds can cause large fires to "leap" across fire breaks and high temperatures and drought prolong a fire's life.Another technique sometimes employed by firefighters is a "backfire" - creating a controlled blaze to either clear dry woodland and starve the fire of fuel, or with the aim of joining up with the main blaze so the combined fire burns itself out.
