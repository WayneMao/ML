Airbus wings ship Ciudad de Cadiz remains on Dee estuary
A ship which carries aircraft wings from Airbus in Flintshire to France remains grounded on a Dee estuary sandbank after slipping its moorings in high winds.The Ciudad de Cadiz moved slightly at high tide on Thursday, but it is still stuck on a sandbank off Mostyn port.The 125m-long ship, which had a 23-person crew, has been secured by three tugs, Liverpool Coastguard said.Coastguards said attempts to move the ship were continuing.The incident happened off Mostyn port at about 13:45 GMT on Wednesday.Airbus said it is not a safety issue and "is nothing to be concerned about".It is understood the ship was waiting to go into port to pick up wings made at the Airbus plant at Broughton for delivery to the company's assembly factory at Toulouse in southern France.The ship is one of three vessels used to ferry wings for the A380 Airbus super jumbo.No lifeboats have been called out to stand by the vessel.Paul Kirby, duty watch manager at Liverpool coastguard, said a fresh attempt would be made to refloat the vessel at the next high water at lunchtime on Thursday.Paul Kirby, duty watch manager at Liverpool coastguard, explained how the Ciudad de Cadiz got stuck on the sandbank near Mostyn harbour."A gust came through Mostyn in excess of 50 to 55 knots," said Mr Kirby. "Unfortunately, the stern lines and forward lines snapped and drifted out into the River Dee itself."He said that the ship has settled in a relatively safe position on a flat sandbank at Salisbury Bank just off Mostyn harbour."The vessel's upright and everything's intact," said Mr Kirby."There's no signs of pollution and the ship's crew are all OK onboard."
