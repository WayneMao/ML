Barrow hospital maternity unit given recommendations
The midwifery regulator has recommended 19 areas where a maternity unit where several babies died "must improve".The unit, at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow, is under investigation after the deaths of a number of babies and mothers.The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) said governance, risk management, collaborative working and leadership needed to improve.However, it said some improvements had been made since a review in September.The NMC said it would ensure improvements were made by the trust.The trust said it has welcomed the report, and a spokesperson said: "We are pleased that the NMC recognised that there have been a number of significant service improvements."We have already acted on many of the recommendations contained in the NMC report and have invited in a highly experienced clinical advisory team to offer mentorship and support to clinicians and senior management."The NMC visited the Morecambe Bay Trust at the same time as the Care Quality Commission (CQC).The CQC last month gave the hospital trust until mid-November to sort out what it called "significant problems".
