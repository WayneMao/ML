We see it as a fun day too, a celebration not solemn commemoration. Let's salute and celebrate."First Minister Alex Salmond said: "Armed Forces Day is an important opportunity to show how much we value the contribution made by serving soldiers, veterans and military families, as well as honouring those who have made the ultimate sacrifice."
