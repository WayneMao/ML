"I'll try to repay their faith."Murray ended a 77-year wait for a British men's singles champion at Wimbledon with victory over Novak Djokovic in July, an achievement recognised as he won Sports Personality with 56% of the vote.Having finished third in 2012 behind cyclist Bradley Wiggins and heptathlete Jessica Ennis, he became the fourth tennis player to win the award in its 60-year history, after Ann Jones in 1969, Virginia Wade in 1977 and Greg Rusedski in 1997."I know I've not always been the easiest person to support but I've been under a lot of pressure for a long time so I'm just really pleased to break through," added the world number four, who won theUS OpenandOlympictitles in 2012."The support I got at Wimbledon this year was by far the best I'd ever had.
