Action plan to tackle A83 Rest and Be Thankful landslip closures
A taskforce to tackle landslip closures on the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A83 has started forming an action plan.Falling debris has closed the road in Argyll five times in five years.The latest landslip two weeks ago saw the carriageway closed for two days after 1,000 tonnes of debris came off hillsides destabilised by heavy rain.The taskforce, which met in Arrochar, is looking at finding a permanent solution to the problem.Whenever landslips have closed the Rest and Be Thankful a long diversion, adding up to 50 miles to some journeys, has been put in place.High on the taskforce agenda will be the successful delivery of an emergency diversion route along the nearby old military road.Work on this, which will take 12 weeks and cost Â£1.5m, is due to start at the end of August.The first meeting of the taskforce was chaired by Transport Minister Keith Brown.Mr Brown said: "This was a very productive first meeting which heard detailed updates on the emergency diversion route, wider landslip protection works including protective netting, and the feasibility study into long term-solutions to tackle the impact of landslips."While there is a sense of frustration from many in the local community that the emergency route is not yet up and running, building what is essentially a new trunk road cannot go ahead without the necessary safety checks and detailed planning, as well as agreeing permission from private landowners."Representatives from the haulage industry, tourism sector, mid-Argyll Chamber of Commerce, Argyll and Bute Council and trunk road operator, Scotland TranServ, are expected to attend.
