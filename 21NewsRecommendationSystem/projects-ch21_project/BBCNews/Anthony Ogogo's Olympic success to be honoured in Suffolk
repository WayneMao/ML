Anthony Ogogo's Olympic success to be honoured in Suffolk
Homecoming celebrations have been planned in Suffolk for Olympic bronze medallist Anthony Ogogo.The Lowestoft boxer earned the medal by winning three bouts, including victory over world number one Ievgen Khytrov, before being beaten in the semi-finals.On Tuesday, Ogogo will be presented to his hometown on a stage which is being erected on London Road North.Nick Webb, mayor of Lowestoft, said: "Anthony's outstanding efforts deserve to be marked publicly."Mr Webb said the middleweight boxer would also be given a shield, as a "small but lasting token of how proud we all are of him".The event will start at 17:00 BST.Colin Law, leader of the Conservative-run Waveney District Council, said the homecoming would be a fitting tribute to Ogogo.He had considered pulling out of the Olympics after his mother Teresa had a brain aneurysm."We all know that Anthony had personal battles as well as the best of the world's boxers to contest with during London 2012," said Mr Law."His courage and success has won him even more supporters across the whole of Waveney."He has also been invited to attend a full council meeting on 26 September.Ogogo's achievement will also be marked in Ipswich on Saturday.He will be joined by fellow local Olympians Elena Baltacha, Louise Jukes and Harry Martin at a civic reception at Suffolk County Council's Endeavour House headquarters.The quartet will then have a lap of honour at Portman Road ahead of Ipswich Town's match with Blackburn Rovers.
