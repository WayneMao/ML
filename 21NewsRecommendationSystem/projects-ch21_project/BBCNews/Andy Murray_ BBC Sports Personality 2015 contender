It's a combination of realising he had a shot and seeing in his team-mates there was something he could pull out of them."There's something about tennis where you don't get to play as part of a team that often. So for that moment in time, it's nice to be in a team."John:"Andy Murray should be #spoty. Yeah he won a couple of years ago but he's Britain's greatest ever."KayL:"Andy Murray should win. His part in winning the Davis Cup was total commitment for Great Britain...not just one event."Noptajoe:"Andy Murray is the second best player in the world at the third most popular sport in the world. No other Brit can compare."It's fun, accessible across a vast range of fitness levels and abilities, and not as elitist as some might believe.Visit theGet Inspiredwebsite to find out more on how to get intotennis.Media playback is not supported on this device
