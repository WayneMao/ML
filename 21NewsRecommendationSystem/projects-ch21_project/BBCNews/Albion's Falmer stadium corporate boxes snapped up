Albion's Falmer stadium corporate boxes snapped up
All the corporate boxes at Brighton and Hove Albion's new stadium at Falmer have now been sold, according to the football club.Work on the construction of the 22,500-seater ground, is due to be completed in September 2011 at a cost of Â£93m.The club said its 14 corporate boxes had been snapped up, as well as about half of its 2,500 luxury seats.Brighton and Hove Albion have been without a stadium since their former home closed in 1997 and was then sold.The initial planning application for stadium on land north of Village Way, in Falmer, was submitted to Brighton and Hove City Council in 2001.It was accepted by the government in July 2007 after a High Court challenge and two public inquiries.Fans of the Seagulls, including DJ Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - attended an official "kick-off" ceremony at the site in Falmer when construction work began in December 2008.
