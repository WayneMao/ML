Assembly Rooms fire: Three option 'vision' for Derby venue
Three options of repair, improve or replace are being considered for a fire-damaged Derby concert venue.In March, the plant room at the Derby Assembly rooms was destroyed and the rest of the complex was smoke-logged.Now the city council is looking at either a return to its original state, costing £6m, upgrading facilities at a cost of up to £18m or building a new centre, costing about £80m.Officials said they would decide on a strategy by Christmas.The city council also said insurance was unlikely to cover the full cost of even the most basic option so it would have to dip into its reserves no matter what.Martin Rawson, deputy leader of Derby City Council. said continuing talks with other organisations would produce a city centre "vision"."A vision is about where we want to be and we have to be ambitious for the city and look at the big picture."Then we have to go away and do the work and look at where we can get funding to make it happen."
