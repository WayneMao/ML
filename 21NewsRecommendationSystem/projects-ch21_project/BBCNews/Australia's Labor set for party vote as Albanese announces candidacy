The ballot will take a month and former treasurer Chris Bowen will be party leader in the interim."Today the Labor Party begins the process of becoming a bigger, more transparent, more democratic party," he said."The Labor Party is big enough and mature enough to conduct this process in a way which shows the Australian people that we will be ready for government whenever we're called upon next."The party is electing its new leader under new rules introduced by Kevin Rudd on the eve of the election to make it harder for party leaders to be removed by party factions.Labor was thrown out of office in Saturday's general election, with the Tony Abbott-led Liberal-National coalition securing a decisive win. The new government will be sworn in on Monday.The lead-up to the polls was dominated by Labor infighting, with Julia Gillard replaced by Kevin Rudd as prime minister and Labor leader after a leadership challenge just weeks from the election.Mr Rudd says he will remain a back-bench MP.
