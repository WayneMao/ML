Alderney doctor deaths investigation dropped
A police investigation into four deaths in Alderney has found "no evidence of criminality" on the part of a doctor whose surgery was raided by officers.Guernsey Policeraided the Eagle Medical Practiceof Dr Rory Lyons and a private address on 2 April.Chief Patrick Rice has now said the investigation had "ceased with immediate effect".The General Medical Council (GMC) confirmed Dr Lyons remains suspended while its investigation is carried out.A spokesman said no further comments would be made.Mr Rice said: "Should the GMC find anything which causes them concern in a criminal context they are of course able to refer the matter back to us."He said he was "well aware" the investigation had caused "significant distress to the doctor in question, the families of those who died and the wider Alderney community".Mr Rice said: "While three months will undoubtedly have felt a long time for those involved."We will always go where the evidence takes us, and on this occasion it has led us to this conclusion."He said during the "complex and detailed" investigation "a significant amount of medical records were seized but no arrests were made".Anindependent medical expertwas brought in to review those files.The deaths occurred in the Mignot Memorial Hospital, which is run by Guernsey's Health and Social Services Department. It was the department that took "serious concerns" to police.A spokesman said: "We could not possibly have ignored a serious complaint following the death of a patient", but the doctor and Alderney community could be "reassured that this matter has been fully, properly and expertly investigated".Dr Lyons is one of four doctors in Alderney - the other three work at the Island Medical Practice - and he dealt with about 500 patients from the island's 1,900-strong population.In a statement he said: "I am aware that this has also been a very difficult time for the families concerned."My wife Dilys and I would like to thank the community, and my colleagues, for their continued support throughout this challenging period."
