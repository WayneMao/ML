Adam Voges: Middlesex sign batsman to replace Chris Rogers
Middlesex have signed Australian batsman Adam Voges as their overseas player for the 2015 season.The 35-year-old replaces Chris Rogers, who is expected to be absent for most of the year because of international commitments, and will captain the side in the Championship in his stead.Top-order batsman Voges had a spell with Middlesex last year.He played in 13 games in one-day competition and thendeputised for Rogers in first-class cricket.Veteran opener Rogers had to be replacedwhen he was included in Australia's Ashes squad last year.The 37-year-old is set to be away from Lord's for much of 2015 as Australia have a tour of West Indies next May and then come to England for an Ashes series, which will run until late August."The absence of Chris Rogers has left a major hole to fill," said Middlesex managing director of cricket Angus Fraser."We believe we have a more than capable replacement in Adam. During the time he previously spent with us he made an extremely positive impression both on and off the pitch."I would like to thank Adam for agreeing to captain the team in four-day cricket in 2015 and he will provide us with experience, skill and quality in this department."Voges, who is currently captaining Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield, has previously played in county cricket forHampshireandNottinghamshire.The right-hander, who made his first-class debut in the 2002-03 season, averages 41.83 in first-class cricket and has played 31 one-day internationals and seven Twenty20 internationals for Australia.Meanwhile, Middlesex have handed a three-year deal to batsman Nick Gubbins.The 20-year-old played four Championship and three List A matches for the club last season.
