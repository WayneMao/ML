Autumn Statement: Wait longer for your state pension
So the state pension age (SPA) is going to be raised even more quickly than previously planned.In his Autumn Statement, the Chancellor, George Osborne, announced that it would now go up to 68 sometime in the mid-2030s, rather than between 2044 and 2046.That is about 10 years earlier than originally planned.The government won't say how many more people will now have to wait another year to receive their state pension.That is because the precise date for the implementation of the policy will be decided in a few years' time by a government commission.However, one pension expert, Tom McPhail of the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, has estimated that this change will probably affect 8-10 million people, as roughly 800,000 people a year reach the current SPA and their numbers will rise as the population grows.Who needs to care?A Treasury spokesman said the bulk of people who will be affected would currently be in their mid to late 40s.One thing is certain, though: the revised policy will save an awful lot of money."The figures previously published show that delaying the state pension age by one year saves the government £13bn," said Malcolm McLean, a consultant at the actuaries Barnett Waddingham."Further rises in the state pension age and linking it to life expectancy are not unexpected given that people continue to live longer and therefore the cost of providing a state pension will inevitably increase."Indeed, the Autumn Statement says the latest rise in the state pension age, along with the other scheduled increases, might eventually save taxpayers about £500bn over the next 50 years.When will it affect you?
