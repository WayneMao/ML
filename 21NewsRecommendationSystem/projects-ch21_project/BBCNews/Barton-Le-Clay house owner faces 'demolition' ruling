Barton-Le-Clay house owner faces 'demolition' ruling
A home owner involved in a long-running saga over an extension may have to demolish part of his house after an inspector ruled against him.Syed Raza Shah got permission to increase the floor space of his home in Barton-Le-Clay, Bedfordshire, by 45%, in 2011.But, Central Bedfordshire Council said he increased the house's-size by 165%.Following anumber of legal challenges, a planning inspector has refused a retrospective planning bid.Barring further appeals by Mr Shah, the council may now consider enforcing the decision to demolish parts of the building not covered by the 45% extension given permission.Councillor Nigel Young, executive member for regeneration on the council, said: "Mr Shah must return the dwelling to a state which does not do overwhelming harm to the green belt."This could involve "demolishing" the house's east wing, which the inspector found "particularly obtrusive".In May 2013, an inspector granted retrospective planning permission for the home, named Random House, but the council challenged the decision.The council argued Mr Shah's alterations amounted to a "new dwelling" and was "inappropriate development" in an area of outstanding natural beauty.Mr Shah, who is expected to appeal against the decision to the High Court, has not commented.
