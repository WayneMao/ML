Appointment of new crime chief's exec 'appropriate'
Appointing a new North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner's chief executive after the previous chief executive was given voluntary redundancy was "appropriate", a review has found.A complaint was made to the force area's police and crime panel after the commissioner, Winston Roddick, advertised the job.Previous chief executive Anna Humphreys received the payment after deciding not to return after maternity leave.Mr Roddick has welcomed the decision.Conwy county borough council's solicitor, Richard Jarvis, who investigated the complaint, found the payment was "proper and appropriate".It is a legal requirement for police and crime commissioners to have a chief executive who acts as a monitoring officer to ensure the commissioner acts within the law at all times.Mr Roddick said: "The criticism of my decision was driven by politics and not the public interest... it would have been unlawful and therefore totally irresponsible not to appoint a chief executive."Thirty-six members of staff, including Ms Humphreys, were approved for redundancy scheme set up by North Wales Police.
