Appeal over A&amp;E winter pressures in Pembrokeshire
An accident and emergency unit in Pembrokeshire is facing increased pressure, with managers urging patients only to attend if they "really need it".The Hywel Dda board said Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest is "currently under extreme pressure".Health officials said it means the A&amp;E unit at the hospital is very busy.The public has been asked to follow 'Choose Well' advice before deciding whether A&amp;E is appropriate."Only go to A&amp;E if you really need it," said a spokesperson for the health board."The public are therefore being urged to help reduce the pressures by 'Choosing Well' to ensure busy emergency services are available to those who most need them, but also that you get the right treatment, in the right place and in the shortest possible time."Last month, patients in a neighbouring health board were given a similar warning about pressures at Morriston Hospital's A&amp;E department in Swansea.
