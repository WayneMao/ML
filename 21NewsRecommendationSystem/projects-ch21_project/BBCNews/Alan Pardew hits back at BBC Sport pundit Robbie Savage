Alan Pardew hits back at BBC Sport pundit Robbie Savage
Media playback is not supported on this deviceAlan Pardew has criticised pundit Robbie Savage for writing in his BBC Sport column that the Newcastle manager sounded like a "broken man".Savage said that it was "hard to see" Pardew keeping his job after theheavy defeat by Southamptonlast weekend.After his team fought back to draw 2-2 with Hullon Saturday, Pardew said: "I thought that article was not right and we've had a lot of press like that."He said I was a broken man and I was far from that this week."Pardew's Newcastle were bottom of the Premier League with two points after the 4-0 loss against the Saints.Former Wales international Savage wrote: "It is hard to see Newcastle manager Alan Pardew surviving in his job for much longer - his side were torn apart by Southampton last weekend and he sounded like a broken man in his interviews after that game."The mass protest against Pardew expected at St James' Park failed to materialise against Hull as two Papiss Cisse goals saw his side fight back from 2-0 down to salvage a point.Pardew thanked the "80% of fans who were terrific" and praised his team's character before turning on Savage."Sometimes there's some really unfair things," Pardew, who on Fridayaccused his club's fans of mass hysteria,told BBC Sport."I've tried to carry the job with dignity and be honest and sometimes it's nice if professionals in the game reflect that."Sometimes it's also important to know we're trying to do an honest job."It's not just about me, it's about my staff who come in every day and want to make this team better. It's something I feel very strongly about defending and that's an example of which I thought was wrong."Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Savage defended his comments."I stand by what I said about Alan Pardew after the game against Southampton because I didn't say he was a broken man, I said he sounded like a broken man," he said."His team was poor, he had to face the press and in the post-match press conference he sounded dejected."The passion in his voice this week was better. He was in a stronger position after drawing 2-2 and the fans were behind him, but I stand by what I said."You are there to be shot at. I was a player and the amount of times I have been hammered after games... I wanted to prove them wrong."I hope I have given him that energy to go on and keep his job."
