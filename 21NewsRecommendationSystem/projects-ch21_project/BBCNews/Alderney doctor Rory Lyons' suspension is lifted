Alderney doctor Rory Lyons' suspension is lifted
The suspension of Alderney doctor Rory Lyons has been lifted along with the restrictions on his practising medicine.The General Medical Council (GMC) confirmed Dr Lyons was "registered with a licence to practise", but would not comment on its investigation.It is unclear if a serious incident inquiry by Guernsey's Health and Social Services Department (HSSD) is ongoing.Dr Lyons thanked the community for its "overwhelming support".In a statement he said: "My family and I would like to express our thanks to my colleagues in Guernsey and the Alderney community for their overwhelming support and kindness throughout this period."I can confirm that restrictions on my General Medical Council licence to practise have been removed."However, as an investigation is still ongoing, I am unable to comment further on this case."Dr Lyons' media representative said the investigation was part of the GMC process, but the council said it was unable to confirm or deny if the doctor was the subject of any ongoing investigations.Last month an investigation by Guernsey Police, started after the health department raised "serious concerns",was dropped.Alderney politicians havecalled for an inquiryover the decision to involve police.A HSSD spokeswoman said the department was "committed to fully reviewing the processes that led to it referring serious concerns to the GMC and Guernsey Police".She said: "HSSD welcomes the support of Policy Council to initiate a review that will be undertaken by people completely independent of HSSD, and the department will participate fully and openly."A Policy Council spokesman said: "The timing of this review will be reliant on the sourcing and availability of a suitable independent reviewer and the outcome of processes set in place by the GMC."A further statement on the terms of reference, timing and deadlines will be made later in the summer."Inquiries began after concerns were raised about the deaths of four patients at the Mignot Memorial Hospital, run by HSSD, who had been under the care of Dr Lyons.He runs one of Alderney's two GP surgeries - the Eagle Medical Practice - and is one of four doctors in the island.Dr Lyons was suspended ahead of police raids on his practice and a private residence.The HSSD spokeswoman said: "While HSSD understands that people want further information about exactly what happened in this case, we cannot share confidential information."[The department] must always respond properly to complaints and that means we must investigate each and every complaint we receive."In short, we can never ignore concerns that are raised directly with us about the death of a patient."
