Athletics: Hannah Brier equals Welsh women's 100m record
Hannah Brier equalled the Welsh women's senior 100 metre record in her heat at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Cali, Colombia on Thursday.The 17-year-old ran 11.39 seconds in the heats to equal the mark held by Sallyann Short and Elaine O'Neill.If Brier's form this season continues in the semi-finals she is likely to claim the Welsh record outright.The Swansea Harrier took both the 100m and 200m titles at the2015 Welsh Championshipsin Cardiff in June.Brier's time in the heats in Cali was equalled by Trinidad &amp; Tobago's Khalifa St Fort, with America's Candace Hill - who has a best time of 10.98sec - ran the third fastest time of 11.47sec.The marker laid down by those three suggests the medals could well be shared amongst the trio if, as expected, they qualify for the final.
