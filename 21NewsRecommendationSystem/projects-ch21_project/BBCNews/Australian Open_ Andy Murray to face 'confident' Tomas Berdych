He strikes the ball very well. He serves well. He's fairly calm on the court. I think he manages his emotions fairly well."Murray is a three-time finalist at Melbourne Park and, guided by coach and former champion Amelie Mauresmo, haswon his first five matchesfor the loss of just one set.There have been few alarms along the way, with the Scot raising his level when requiredagainst Grigor Dimitrovand Nick Kyrgios in the last two rounds."The further down the road you get, the better players you play, there's going to be more times when you might get behind or you might get broken or they might play great tennis for a few games," Murray added."You need to be able to weather the storm and hopefully come through it. So far it's been a good sign."Mauresmo was brought into the Murray teamlast Junefollowing the departure of Ivan Lendl, and she worked with Vallverdu until the Venezuelanleft the camp in November.While Vallverdu has dismissed any talk of a rift, Murray said at the start of the tournament that "when things aren't working well, there's not a positive atmosphere, it's not good for anybody".Berdych, 29, has been impressed with his new coach after ending a 17-match losing streak against Nadal, and believes Vallverdu's inside knowledge could help on Thursday."Definitely it might be an advantage for us, but that's how it is," said Berdych, who has yet to drop a set."What is more important is to be prepared for that match, to be ready, to set up the plan, and try to execute it on the court."Really the preparation is exactly the same like for all my past opponents so far here. I'm not going to change anything else with that."
