Amy Winehouse shirt sold for Niamh Curry raises £3,000
A shirt owned by Amy Winehouse has sold for £3,000, despite the death of a five-year-old girl for whom it was due to raise funds.Mitch Winehouse, the singer's father, donated the shirt to Special Auction Services in Newbury to raise funds for the charity Niamh's Next Step.The money had been to pay for cancer treatment for Niamh Curry, from Northamptonshire, who died on Monday.The shirt was bought by an anonymous bidder from Chorley, Lancashire.All of the money raised will be donated to Niamh's Next Step, to help other children suffering from cancer.The UK size six shirt, which was one of the singer's personal items, went under the hammer at about 12:30 BST.Winehouse designed it in collaboration with British clothing brand Fred Perry and released it in her Spring 2011 collection.The singer, 27, was found dead at her home in Camden, north London, on 23 July 2011.Before the sale, Neil Shuttleworth, of the auctioneers, said: "Amy's family have donated it to the charity."Unfortunately the young girl passed away two days ago, but we'll continue to sell it to build towards the total to help other children."It goes to show how crucial the fundraising was."Niamh, from Northamptonshire, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a form of aggressive childhood cancer which attacks the nervous system, in 2010 when she was three.Her family set up an online campaign to raise money to pay for treatment at The Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.Alison Moy, chief executive of The Neuroblastoma Alliance, said: "We're encouraging anyone to carry on donating to the charity because all the funds raised go towards Niamh's legacy."We know she inspired lots of people around her and her legacy will be far reaching and go towards other children who need treatment abroad."
