Asafa Powell runs 9.84secs to set fastest 100m time this year
Asafa Powell ran the fastest 100m in the world this year, clocking 9.84 seconds at the Jamaica International Invitational in Kingston on Saturday.The former world record holder, 32,who served a drugs ban last year,beat American Ryan Bailey (9.93) and fellow Jamaican Nesta Carter (9.98).It was his best time in five years.US Olympic champion Sanya Richards-Ross ran the first sub-50 seconds of 2015 in the women's 400m, ahead of Britain's Christine Ohuruogu who finished fifth.Powell, who has a best of 9.72 for the 100m, was suspended from competition in April 2014 after testing positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine at the 2013 Jamaican national championships.He claimed not to have knowingly taken a banned substance and argued the results came from a contaminated version of a legal supplement. In July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced his ban from 18 months to six, clearing him to compete again immediately.Powell, Bailey and Carter became the first three men to break 10 seconds in 2015.
