Alternative recycling bank site proposed
Work is continuing to try to find a permanent home for a recycling bank in St Martin, Guernsey.The old facility at Manor Stores closed last year and the bins moved to a temporary site at St Martin's Garage.The Public Services Department has since been looking for a new permanent home for the bins in the parish.While discussions are continuing with the owners of Manor Stores a planning application has been put forward for an alternative in Burnt Lane.A spokesperson for the department said: "We are very keen that the parish does not lose its recycling facilities, so we are looking at all options to maintain these provisions."
