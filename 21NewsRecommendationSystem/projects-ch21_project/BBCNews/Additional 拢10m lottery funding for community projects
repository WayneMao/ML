The children have been very much involved and are very excited that funding has been awarded."It is wonderful that Big Lottery Fund Scotland's Community Spaces grant has recognised the strong community spirit in Bannerfield and everyone is looking forward to the improved facilities this funding will deliver."Announcing the funding, Big Lottery Fund Scotland chairwoman Maureen McGinn said: "Our Community Spaces programme allows local people to get together and shape their neighbourhood by making better use of outdoor and indoor spaces."Today's investment allows for the development, improvement and creation of village halls, community gardens, art centres, sports and play facilities."For some areas, the refurbishment of a village hall will create a welcoming centre which can support a range of activities. For others, the transformation of a disused space offers a secure recreational place for everyone to enjoy."
