AES says Glenmorie wind farm concerns 'addressed'
The company behind plans to build 34 turbines in Sutherland has said it has addressed concerns about the project's impact on the landscape.AES's proposed Glenmorie Wind Farm went before Highland councillors for comment on Tuesday. They deferred taking a view until after a site visit in January.Steve Hunter, of AES, said he was glad councillors were giving the project serious consideration.He said it could be constructed without "unacceptable impacts".The Scottish government has the final say on AES's planning application, but opposition from Highland Council to the project would lead to a public inquiry.The local authority's planning officers have recommended that councillors raise no objection.Landscape conservation charity the John Muir Trust is among the opponents to the wind farm.Planned for Kildermorie and Glencalvie Estate, near Ardgay, the wind farm has been scaled down from 43 to 34 turbines.Mr Hunter said: "We feel we have provided a huge amount of information."In particular, we have responded to concerns by providing additional information. We feel that people can be confident this plant can be constructed without unacceptable impacts."
