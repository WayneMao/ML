Aidan O'Brien's Camelot wins Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster
The Aidan O'Brien-trained Camelot was made a firmer favourite for next year's Epsom Derby after an impressive win in the Racing Post Trophy, the last Group One race of the British flat season.The unbeaten colt, ridden by O'Brien's teenage son Joseph, went off as 10-11 favourite at Doncaster.Camelot is now as low as 3-1 for the Epsom race on 2 June, 2012.Elsewhere, Master Minded was well beaten behind Albertas Run and Pure Faith in Aintree's Old Roan Chase.The dual Queen Mother Champion Chase winner, who went off as 2-5 favourite, was never really in contention on his first run of the season and Albertas Run (5-2), who had finished behind Master Minded in April's Melling Chase at the Grand National meeting, led from start to finish.But he had to battle hard to beat the outsider Pure Faith from the Peter Bowen yard in the three-runner race.Master Minded is being aimed at the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day where he is set to take on Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, whose price has been shortened.Jockey Ruby Walsh, said: "He was disappointing. I don't know if it's down to fitness, we'll have to look at the race again."Georgie Browne, wife of trainer Paul Nicholls, added: "Ascot [Amlin 1965 Chase] was the plan but this race came along and looked a nice option."If he's only 90% on his game, it seems to make a big difference."At Doncaster, Camelot was never troubled and once he coolly took the lead on the stand side three furlongs out, he was in control for the trainer's sixth victory in the race."I think he is a very smart horse and I knew I was on the best one in the race," said O'Brien junior, who was celebrating his first Group One win in Britain."He hasn't run for a while and looked a bit fresh the first furlong but he did well and never came off the bridle."His trainer father added: "The data we were getting from him at home was showing up as something out of the ordinary."Although you are only reading that stuff, he still had to come here today and prove it."He's a super-quick thinker with a lovely temperament and he's a joy to have anything to do with."He can do probably whatever you want. The boys [his Coolmore owners] will make the decision [about where he runs], but you saw the speed."
