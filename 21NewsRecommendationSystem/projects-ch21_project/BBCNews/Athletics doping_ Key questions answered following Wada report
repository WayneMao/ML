Athletics doping: Key questions answered following Wada report
Media playback is not supported on this deviceAthletics has been shaken by the doping allegations contained in the World Anti-Doping Association's (Wada)independent report- but who is involved and what might it mean for the future of athletics?The report was commissioned to investigate revelations in a documentary byGerman broadcaster ARDlast year that alleged widespread doping in Russian athletics.It looked at claims made in that programme by whistleblowers from inside the Russian system, including former Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) official Vitaly Stepanov and his wife Yulia (nee Rusanova), formerly an 800m runner who was banned for doping.There was also testimony from Russian athletes, including former London Marathon winner Liliya Shobukhova, who admitted to taking drugs and observing corruption.It also found evidence of destruction of samples, interference with doping controls, and payment of bribes to conceal positive tests.Medicine and syringes were found in athletes' rooms at a training camp. The report noted that such was the atmosphere of intimidation, many of its interviewees were afraid to testify for fear of reprisals.It has been mixed. The Kremlin hasdescribed the accusations as "groundless".The All-Russian Athletics Federation (Araf) said past problems with doping had been tackled and accused Wada of avoiding established protocols for dealing with doping.The Araf general secretary Mikhail Butov told BBC Newsnight that they were working to "change the mentality of coaches" but that any ban would punish their "clean athletes".Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that thousands of samples were destroyed, but says Russia only did so at Wada's request. Domestically, Russian officials have been painting the report as a "politically motivated hit-job".However, a statement from the sports ministry said Russia was "fully committed to the fight against doping in sport" and would be prepared to co-operate more closely in order "to perfect its anti-doping system".And Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded "professional co-operation" with anti-doping bodies afterordering an investigationinto the claims."The battle must be open," said Putin. "A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."Wada's report recommended that five athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime bans for alleged doping violations.These allegations are unproven and the athletes (named below) are yet to respond to the report's findings.The athletes listed below were mentioned in the ARD documentary in December 2014 but the commission says a number of others should also be investigated.Pound's views that these revelations were just the tip of the iceberg wereechoed by UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner,who suggested there are "four, five or six nations that athletics really has a problem with".Yet the implications of the report may also not be limited to athletics alone, with Pound adding it is "not the only sport with a doping problem."Baseball and cycling have also been beset by doping scandals in recent times, while a corruption crisis still engulfsworld football's governing body Fifa.IAAF president Lord Coe has asked Russia for a response to the report by Friday, when a council will convene to decide the next step.Media playback is not supported on this deviceA potential sanction could be the suspension of Russia if such a proposal receives a majority vote, and it could mean Russian athletes are banned from next year's Olympic Games in Rio.Russia is a global sporting power, having hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and is due to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup.The report could also have implications for Russia's right to host such events, with UK Athletics chief Warner calling for the country to be stripped of next year's IAAF World Junior Championships in Kazan.Britain's Goldie Sayers finished fourth in the javelin at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.She told BBC Sport the situation had left her "frustrated"."I'm incredibly saddened and devastated for the sport," Sayers said. "When (athletes) train very hard, to think you've been denied those medals is devastating. Not only professionally but emotionally and financially."For most athletes it is the thought that you've lost those moments you'll never get back. That is the hardest pill to swallow."
