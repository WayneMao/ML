Australia PM Abbott 'to learn from Queensland poll rout'
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to learn the lessons from a rout in Queensland state elections.The state's Liberal-National Party, allied to Mr Abbott's ruling coalition, lost the largest political majority in Australian history after just one term.The PM accepted his coalition had "difficulties" but said that government was about competence not popularity.The latest opinion poll suggested his coalition would be defeated if an election were held now.The poll in the Sunday Telegraph registered a drop in support for the coalition from 53.5% in the 2013 national election victory to just 43% now, compared to 57% for Labor.Mr Abbott's personal ratings had slumped to 27%, as opposed to 44% for Labor leader Bill Shorten.Amid rumours Mr Abbott could face challenges for the leadership of his party, the PM said: "There are obviously lessons in the election result last night and we're determined to learn them in Canberra."I accept that we need to learn from the difficulties that we've had, but in the end, government is not a popularity contest, it is a competence contest."The people of Australia elected me as prime minister and they elected my government to get on with the job of governing our country."Queensland's Labor Party leader Annastacia Palaszczuk said: "It's just been absolutely amazing, the support right across the length and breadth of Queensland, it is extremely humbling and we are going to restore good governing to this state."The latest results show Labor on 43 and the LNP on 40. Premier Campbell Newman lost his own seat. The LNP won 78 seats in 2012."My political career is over," Mr Newman said.Attorney-General George Brandis insisted on Sunday there would be no repeat in the Liberal Party of the leadership challenge that tore apart the previous Labor government.However, Mr Abbott will deliver a speech in Canberra on Monday which analysts say will be one of the more important of his career.Jane Prentice, a Liberal National backbencher, told ABC television: "Tony has said he has listened and learned. He is making a keynote speech on Monday at the Press Club but we can't continue as we are. I think that's the lesson from today."Mr Abbott's government faced stinging criticism recently, including from his own party, over his decision to award a knighthood to Queen Elizabeth's husband Philip.
