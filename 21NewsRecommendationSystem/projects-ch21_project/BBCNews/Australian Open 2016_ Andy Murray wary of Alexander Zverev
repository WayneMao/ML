He's obviously improving all the time, so it will be a tough match."British women's number oneJohanna Konta,who faces childhood heroine Venus Williams in the first round of the women's singles, says she will not allow sentiment to affect her performance against the seven-time Grand Slam winner.Konta, 24, played 34-year-old Williams for the first time at Wuhan in October, and exchanged hugs in the locker room with the American eighth seed after her6-4 3-6 7-5 quarter-final defeat."The experience will be different," world number 47 Konta said."It was the first time I played her and she was one of the players I grew up watching when I was younger, so it was definitely a different experience to where I'm at now."Konta is the only Briton left in the women's draw afterHeather Watsonlosta three-set thrilleragainst Hungary's Timea Babos on Monday.As well as Murray and Konta, fellow BritonsDan EvansandAljaz Bedeneare on Tuesday's bill.Evans, who was 772 in the world rankings as recently as May,beat Bjorn Fratangelo 7-5 4-6 6-0in the final round of qualifying.The 25-year-old from Birmingham, now ranked 185, faces 18th seed Feliciano Lopez of Spain on court 13 at approximately 01:30 GMT."It wasn't nice [to be ranked so low] but it's the sport we play and obviously I've come out the other side, and I am hopefully going up the rankings now," he said.Slovenia-born Bedene, who switched nationalityin March,follows Evans on court 13 when he meets American Steve Johnson."I know Johnson plays well," says world number 49 Bedene."He hasn't started the season that good, but he has a great serve, a great forehand.
