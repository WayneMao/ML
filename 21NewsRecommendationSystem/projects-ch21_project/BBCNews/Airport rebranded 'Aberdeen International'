Airport rebranded 'Aberdeen International'
Aberdeen Airport is rebranding itself as Aberdeen International.The change comes after the terminal's parent company dropped the name BAA and allowed its individual airports to operate more independently.It is hoped the new title will help the airport's drive to expand its roster of destinations - particularly for holidaymakers.Airport managing director Derek Provan said: "This is an exciting time for the airport and for our customers."He added: "We have been successful in recent years in introducing new international routes to Aberdeen, and will continue to strive to do so."
