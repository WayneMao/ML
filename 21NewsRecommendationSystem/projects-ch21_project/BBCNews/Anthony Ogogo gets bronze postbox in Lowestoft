Anthony Ogogo gets bronze postbox in Lowestoft
A mystery fan of Olympic boxer Anthony Ogogo has painted a postbox bronze in the pugilist's home town of Lowestoft.Ogogo, 23, won bronze in the middleweight category last week.Royal Mail has been honouring British gold medallists by painting postboxes gold in their home towns - but is not doing the same for bronze medallists.Nick Webb, mayor of the Suffolk town, said: "I know absolutely nothing about who's behind painting the postbox, but whoever it is - congratulations."He added: "It's nothing less than the boy deserves."The company said the postbox, on Rectory Road, would be repainted red.Royal Mail said it had painted more than 50 postboxes across the UK.A spokesperson said: "Prior to the Olympics, we announced an extensive programme that would involve painting postboxes gold to celebrate any individual and team athletes that won a gold medal."Royal Mail congratulates every single member of Team GB on their success at the Olympics."However, due to the scale of the programme, we are sorry but we do need to limit the programme to those athletes who have won a gold medal."Last week a man who painted a postbox in Lymington gold was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and held in a police cell overnight.Father-of-three Rob Smith, 51, painted the postbox in protest at Royal Mail's decision to honour gold medal-winning Olympic sailor Ben Ainslie with a golden postbox in Cornwall, where he grew up, and not in the Hampshire town where he lives.Royal Mail described his actions as "vandalism".
