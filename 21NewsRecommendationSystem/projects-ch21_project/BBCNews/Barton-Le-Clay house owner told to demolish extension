Barton-Le-Clay house owner told to demolish extension
A man who turned a bungalow into a three-storey mansion must demolish the extension within 12 months, a planning inspector has ruled.Syeed Raza Shah was given planning permission to increase the floor space of his house in Barton-Le-Clay, Bedfordshire, by about 45% in 2011.But Central Bedfordshire Council said he increased the size of the house by 165%.Mr Shah must now restore the house to its pre-existing design.Read this and more stories from Beds, Bucks and HertsPlanning inspector Diane Lewis said: "The differences are substantial when compared to the extension and alteration work approved under the 2011 permission."In May 2013, an inspector granted retrospective planning permission for the home but the council challenged the decision, arguing Mr Shah's alterations amounted to an "inappropriate development" in an area of outstanding natural beauty.In her ruling, Ms Lewis said the site was causing "serious harm" to the green belt and "in the public interest, should be remedied as soon as reasonably possible."Jason Longhurst, from the council, said: "This outcome sends a clear message that, while we have a fair approach to the planning process which supports and guides residents, when this advice is breached we will apply robust enforcement measures in dealing with any unlawful, excessive, unsustainable or damaging developments."Mr Shah said he felt the whole situation was "ridiculous".He previously described the house, named Random House, as an "eyesore" when he bought it in 2008 and said he believed his work had improved the property.
