Alan Shearer will not become new Cardiff City manager
Alan Shearer will not be the new manager of Cardiff City after holding "unsuccessful" talks with the club.The ex-Newcastle boss said in a statement: "I can confirm that I was one of the candidates that the club spoke to about the vacant position."During these talks I was most impressed with the vision, ambition and determination of the owner Dato Chan Tien Ghee and the board."Unfortunately, those talks were unsuccessful on this occasion."The former England captain added:  "Cardiff City is a great club and I wish them every success next season."Roberto di Matteo(ex-West Brom, MK Dons, between clubs)Chris Hughton(ex-Newcastle, between clubs)Malky Mackay(Watford)Derek McInnes(St Johnstone)Shearer's only previous managerial role was his ill-fated spell in charge of Newcastle at the tail end of the 2008-09 season.The Magpies legend won only one of his eight games in charge as the club were relegated from the Premier League.The Bluebirds have been without a manager since parting company with Dave Jones on 30 May in the wake of their Championship play-off semi-final defeat by Reading.Shearer was one of only a handful of candidates being considered for the post.Former West Bromwich Albion coach Roberto di Matteo, ex-Newcastle boss Chris Hughton, Watford manager Malky Mackay and St Johnstone's Derek McInnes have also been linked with the role.Last week, Watford released a statement stating that "no official approach for the services" for Mackay had been received.Mackay replaced current Swansea City boss Brendan Rodgers in the Vicarage Road hotseat in June 2009 when Rodgers left for Reading.McInnes led Perth side St Johnstone to the First Division title in 2009. In May, he rejected an offer to become the new Brentford boss. Hughton and Di Matteo, who led their former clubs to promotion from the Championship two seasons ago, are currently out of work.
