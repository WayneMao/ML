Andre Villas-Boas says he doesn't need help at Chelsea
Media playback is not supported on this deviceChelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has dismissed suggestions he needs help at Stamford Bridge.Former Blues boss Guus Hiddink has been linked with a return to the club after heleft his post with Turkeylast week.But Villas-Boas said: "I don't agree [that I need help.] I don't solve problems on my own, I solve problems with my group of people and my group of players.It's a situation of life and death in that Champions League group"I just hold on to my self-belief and the belief of my players."Chelsea conceded a last-minute goal in Germany in midweek asBayer Leverkusen inflicted a fourth defeat in the last seven games.The Blues have been left needing a win against Valencia in their final Champions League group game next week to guarantee qualification and Villas-Boas admits that the pressure is on."It's a situation of life and death in that group," he said.*Abramovich bought the club in July 2003; Ranieri had been manager since September 2000"We expect Leverkusen to do their job against Genk and qualify first. Then it's either Chelsea or Valencia in the Champions League last 16."The 34-year-old has seen his side fall 12 points behind Manchester City at the top of the Premier League after a poor run of form but is confident that he retains the full backing of owner Roman Abramovich as he attempts to keep the club on track.Asked if he has the backing of Abramovich, he said: "Yes."The spotlight is something that doesn't disturb me. It is something that doesn't disturb me whatsoever."It has an obvious knock-on effect but that's the manager's job, to motivate and inspire players. We need to find the right emotional stimulus plus the right balance in terms of what we do to get the results we want."But we have not had critical meetings, there is no animosity, not insults here and there, no critique whatsoever regarding what we are doing, no doubts whatsoever regarding what we are doing."Villas-Boas has also urged his side to emulate Manchester United's ability to close out matches after seeing them concede another late goal in Leverkusen.Glen Johnson scored a late winner for Liverpool at Stamford Bridge last Sunday and three of Chelsea's recent defeats have come late on.Villas-Boas added: "There is the so-called Fergie time and Man United seems very successful in making the most out of that time."In football, you just have to get the focus right in those last minutes."
