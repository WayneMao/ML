Andy Butler: Walsall sign former skipper on loan from Sheff Utd
Injury-hit Walsall have re-signed former skipper Andy Butler on a month's emergency loan from Sheffield United.The 30-year-old centre-half rejected a new Walsall dealto sign for the Blades this summer,thereby ending a daily commute from his South Yorkshire home.But Butler has found his first-team opportunities limited at Bramall Lane in the opening weeks of the new season.And Blades boss Nigel Clough has freed him back to Bescot to ease Walsall's current injury situation.The Saddlers had eight players missing forlast Saturday's 0-0 draw at home to Colchester United."The opportunity has arisen for Andy to go out on loan and get some games," said Walsall boss Dean Smith. "And we're only too happy to have him back here."We were sad to see him leave during the summer but fully understood the reasons behind his decision."It hasn't quite happened for him yet at Sheffield United but, in the meantime, we're delighted to be able to bring him in for a month."His return will give us all a boost. He can help us get back on track. He is someone who knows exactly how we work and will fit in straight away."
