Asafa Powell: Jamaican sprinter to appear before anti-doping panel
Sprinter Asafa Powell will appear at a Jamaican Anti-Doping Committee disciplinary hearing on Tuesday.The former 100m world record holder, 31, tested positive for the banned stimulantoxilofrineat the national championships in June.Training partner Sherone Simpson tested positive for the same stimulant butdenied being a "cheat"at her hearing.Powell was one of several witnesses to testify at Simpson's hearing, which was adjourned until 4 February.The pair are among five Jamaican athletes who failed drugs tests at the national championships. Discus throwers Allison Randall and Traves Smikle and high-jumper Demar Robinson had their disciplinary cases heard last month.Powell and Simpson, who won silver in the 4x100m relay at the London Olympics, have been provisionally suspended since the positive tests were confirmed and missed the World Championships in Moscow last August.They both blamed the positive tests on a new brand of nutritional supplements given to them to them by a recently hired physical trainer, Canadian Chris Xuereb.Xuereb has said he did not give Powell and Simpson any performance-enhancing drugs and only purchased major-brand vitamins, claiming in July that "both athletes are clearlylooking for a scapegoat".Powell was the last man to hold the individual 100m world record before compatriot Usain Boltbroke it in 2008.He later helped Jamaica win 4x100mrelay goldat the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
