Australia man parks wingless aircraft at pub
An Australian man has been charged by police after driving a light plane down the street and parking it at a pub while he went inside for a beer.Police in Newman, Western Australia said the 37-year-old man endangered the life, health and safety of residents.The man had allegedly bought the wingless Beechcraft two-seater aircraft from a private residence and was taking it home when he stopped for a drink.The engine had been left running making it a danger, police said.Local residents were amused to see the sight of a plane parked outside a well-known local spot."On the way back through town... here's a plane parked outside the Purple Pub," Newman resident Beau Woolcock told ABC radio."Even more special was seeing one of the local coppers poking his head in the door of the plane looking like he was asking for a licence."However, police said the incident endangered the lives of local residents as the propeller was left spinning."Kids were coming home from school. It could have been very ugly. All he needed was one gust of wind ... because without the wings, it's not stable," said Newman police sergeant Mark McKenzie"People think it was a bit of a laugh but it was very dangerous and we're not very happy with it."Newman police Sergeant Mark Garner said in a statement after the man was charged that the aircraft was found to have "an exposed fuel line hanging from the side of the aircraft attached to an insecure jerry can inside the cabin to enable the engine to run".The man does not hold a pilot's licence and police said the roads were busy with other vehicles and pedestrians at the time.He is due to appear in court on 18 November.
