Argyll and Bute council leader quits
The leader of Argyll and Bute Council has stepped down after just three months in the post.James Robb was asked to resign by fellow SNP councillors following a meeting on Monday.The 11-strong SNP group had been suspended by the party after inviting the Lib Dems and Conservatives to join its administration.It was threatened with expulsion by the SNP's national executive council if the agreement was not rescinded.At the time of the suspension, an SNP spokesman said: "The policy democratically passed by the SNP's National Council in 2007 requires our council groups to seek approval of the party's National Executive Committee before entering into formal coalition arrangements."The group has not followed that procedure, and therefore as a matter of course has been suspended in the meantime."
