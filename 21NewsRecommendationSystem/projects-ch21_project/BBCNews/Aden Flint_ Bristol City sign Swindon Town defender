When I walked through the door, people said 'have a look at him' and that's what we've been doing. We're delighted to have him on board."I saw Aden play for Alfreton a while back, but in the last 18 months he's improved immensely. I've seen him four or five times since then and he's grown on me."He's not the finished article and we're not bringing in an established centre-half, but he's that type who we can bring in and develop."Swindon recentlytook up an option on Flint's contract,extending his deal for another season. But afterBristol City made an unsuccessful bidfor the player, he handed in a transfer request.City then tabled an improved offer which was accepted last week, and the deal was eventually concluded on Tuesday afternoon.
