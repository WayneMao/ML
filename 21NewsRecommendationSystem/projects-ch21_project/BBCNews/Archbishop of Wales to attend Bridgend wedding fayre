Archbishop of Wales to attend Bridgend wedding fayre
They are the places couples go to find the perfect wedding stationery, dresses and cakes.Now couples attending a wedding fayre in Bridgend will be able to get advice from a man with a wealth of wedding knowledge - the Archbishop of Wales.Dr Barry Morgan will join local clergy manning a stall at the Heronston Hotel on Sunday afternoon.He said he wants to show people that a church wedding is "particularly special"."These days couples have a huge choice of where and how they can marry," he said."The Church has been in the business of marriage longer than anyone and we want to show couples that a church wedding is particularly special."So we're encouraging them to come and see what we can offer and how we can help them."A wedding fayre is a great place in which to do this and I'm looking forward to meeting people this weekend."It is the third year running that clergy from the Bridgend Deanery have run a stand at the local wedding fayre.The Reverend Mike Komor, of Coity, Nolton and Brackla with Coychurch,  said: "The idea first came about a few years ago because we had been talking about how many young people seem to be under the misperception that unless they attend a church they can't get married in one."We hit upon the idea of attending a wedding fayre to raise awareness of this issue."
