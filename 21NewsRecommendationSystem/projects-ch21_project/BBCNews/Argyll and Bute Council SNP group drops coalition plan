Argyll and Bute Council SNP group drops coalition plan
The 11-strong SNP group on Argyll and Bute Council has voted unanimously to abandon a proposed coalition.The group was suspended by the SNP last week after inviting the Conservatives and Lib Dems to join the administration without the approval of the party's National Executive Committee.The fallout saw the SNP's James Robb step down as leader of the council.An SNP spokesman said that discussions with other groups on the council were "on going".
