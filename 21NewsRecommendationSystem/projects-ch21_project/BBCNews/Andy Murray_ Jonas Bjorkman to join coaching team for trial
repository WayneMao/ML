Andy Murray: Jonas Bjorkman to join coaching team for trial
Andy Murray plans to work with Jonas Bjorkman in the next month with a view to the former Wimbledon semi-finalist joining his full-time coaching team.Swede Bjorkman, 42, will assist French Fed Cup captain Amelie Mauresmo, who works with Murray for 25 weeks a year.Bjorkman is a former world number four who retired in 2008.British number one Murray described Bjorkman as "an exceptional tennis player who made the most out of his game" and "a very nice person".Media playback is not supported on this deviceMurray added: "I know him very well from when he played. When I came on the tour when I was young, he was very good to me."He's got a good resume as a player and a lot of the Swedes turn out to be pretty good coaches."I think they have a good mindset, a lot of them are very calm individuals but extremely hard workers - which I know he was as a player."Bjorkman, who is appearing in Sweden's 'Let's Dance' TV series,said:"I'm really looking forward to joining Andy and his team for a test week, which we both hope will lead to joining the team permanently."He was suggested as a replacement for Ivan Lendl when the Czech ended his relationship with Murray a year ago.He won nine grand slam doubles titles, including three successive Wimbledon crowns from 2002 to 2004.Bjorkman was beaten in the last four of the men's singles at the All England Club in 2006 by Roger Federer.Murray parted company with Dani Vallverdu in November and has been looking for a coach to work with when Mauresmo does not travel.Mauresmo joined Murray in Indian Wells this week, the first time they have been together at a tournament since the world number four lost last month's Australian Open final to Novak Djokovic.Since then, Murray has lost in the quarter-finals in Rotterdam and Dubai, before leading Britain to Davis Cup victory over the United States.Bjorkman has been involved with the Stockholm Open and the Swedish Davis Cup team since retiring.
