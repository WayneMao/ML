Alistair Brownlee: Olympic champion claims easy London win
Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee claimed his second win of the World Triathlon Series with a devastating performance in London.The Briton, 27, did not enjoy the best transition between the 750m swim and 20km bike, but caught up before blowing away the field on the 5km run.Brownlee finished in 50 minutes and 39 seconds, 12 seconds ahead of Spain's Fernando Alarza.His brother Jonny was down the field after suffering bike problems.In the women's event, 2014 world championGwen Jorgensenled a USA 1-2-3 in the second of the day's sprint races - half the distance of a standard triathlon series event.The 29-year-old crossed the line in 55.45, 20 seconds ahead of Katie Zaferes, who outsprinted Sarah True over the final 200m. It was Jorgensen's 10th successive win in races she has competed in.Northern Ireland's Aileen Reid took fourth spot, ahead of fellow Briton Vicky Holland, who won in Cape Town last month.Reid, who competed at London 2012, told BBC Sport: "It was half the distance but twice as hard."I had a great run. I didn't think I would run that fast. I want to be in the top 10 in the world."Earlier, the winning Brownlee brother told BBC Sport he "felt so good" during Sunday's sprint race in the capital, having missed the opening three roundsbecause of injury."Some of guys went really quick during the first kilometre of the run," he said."I then got into my stride and felt really good. I was glad to be able to race to the best of my ability. I haven't done that for a while."His brother Jonny expressed his disappointment after a puncture to his bike effectively ended his race."I thought I was in 'dreamworld' after an amazing swim," he said."I then got on the bike and people were shouting that I had a puncture. I then had to fix the problem."When asked whether he could have caught the leaders, Brownlee added: "You feel you can do something, but there was no chance."
