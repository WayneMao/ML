They’ve been shared thousands of times on social media and have been picked up by a plethora of news outlets. But how extraordinary was the event itself, and what exactly was going on?Unlike many other woodpeckers, [green woodpeckers] spend a lot of time feeding on the ground on ants around ants’ nests... The weasel will hang around and wait for an opportunity to eat sort of anything that they can“I’ve never seen anything like it,” says Dr Stuart Marsden, reader in Conservation Ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, who has studied green woodpeckers extensively.Weasels are ferocious predators that usually predate mammals – they can take on animals bigger than themselves and often eat rabbits. But it’s more unusual for them to attack birds.“I wouldn’t think that woodpeckers are often taken,” says Dr Marsden. But woodpeckers are ground birds. Weasels go after their eggs and babies, and sometimes adults that are trying to defend the nest.He thinks the woodpecker was probably feeding in the grass when it was ambushed. The birds’ diet is mainly ants.“Unlike many other woodpeckers, they spend a lot of time feeding on the ground on ants around ants’ nests."“The weasel will hang around and wait for an opportunity to eat sort of anything that they can eat.“They are really vicious and clever,” he adds.“Unfortunately it’s gripped on here and it’s been taken for a ride.”Naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams told the BBC: “These are truly amazing photographs. It’s worth remembering that weasels have a truly catholic diet – I’ve seen them taking fully grown rabbits.“They are incredible predators, so I don’t think it’s that remarkable that one tried to take a woodpecker.“What is remarkable was that it was captured on camera.”Weasel vs woodpeckerGreen woodpeckers grow to around 32cm (12.5in) in length while male weasels measure around 20-22cm (7.9-8.6in) and females reach 15-18cm (5.9-7in)In weight, green woodpeckers vary from 180 to 220g (5.6-7.8oz), while adult weasels usually weigh between 106-131g (3.7-4.6oz) for males and 55-69g (1.9-2.4oz) for females.Dr Marsden told BBC Earth: “For a bird like that to take off from the ground, to lift itself off the ground with a heavy [load] on its back is quite impressive really.”
